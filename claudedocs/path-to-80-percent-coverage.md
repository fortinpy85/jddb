## Coverage Calculation

### Current State
- **Total Statements**: 10,753
- **Covered**: 7,996 (74%)
- **Missing**: 2,757 lines

### Target State (80%)
- **Required Covered**: 8,602 lines
- **Need to Cover**: 606 additional lines

### Coverage Gains by Priority

| Priority | Component | Current | Target | Lines | Overall Gain |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | ai_enhancement_service | 26% | 60% | ~220 | 2.0% |
| 2 | Endpoints (4 areas) | 30-50% | 65% | ~180 | 1.7% |
| 3 | Tasks (3 areas) | 47% | 70% | ~120 | 1.1% |
| 4 | Utilities (3 areas) | 35-53% | 70% | ~90 | 0.8% |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **610** | **5.6%** |

**Projected Final Coverage**: 74% + 5.6% = **79.6% ≈ 80%** ✅

## Risk Mitigation

### Test Failures
- **Current Status**: 5 failing tests across ai_enhancement_service, analysis endpoints, audit_logger
- **Strategy**: Fix failing tests BEFORE adding new ones
- **Time Buffer**: Add 2 hours for fixing existing failures

### Integration Complexity
- **Risk**: Integration tests may reveal service interaction issues
- **Mitigation**: Start with unit tests, add integration tests incrementally
- **Fallback**: Focus on unit test coverage first, integration tests optional

### Time Estimates
- **Optimistic**: 5 days (25 hours)
- **Realistic**: 7 days (35 hours)
- **Pessimistic**: 10 days (50 hours)

**Buffer Strategy**: Plan for realistic timeline, use optimistic as stretch goal

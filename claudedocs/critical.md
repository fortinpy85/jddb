## üî¥ CRITICAL - Application Crashes

### 1. Translate Feature Crashes Application
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Complete application failure requiring page reload
**Status:** ‚ùå FIX ATTEMPTED BUT FAILED

**Description:**
Clicking the "Translate" button from job detail view causes the entire application to crash with an uncaught TypeError.

**Latest Test Results (October 6, 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Translate from header (no job selected): Redirects to jobs list (doesn't crash)
- ‚ùå Translate from job detail view: **STILL CRASHES**

**Error Details:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'segments')
ErrorBoundary caught an error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'segments')
```

**Root Cause:**
The `BilingualEditor` component interface mismatch:
- **Expected:** Component expects a `document` prop containing `segments: BilingualSegment[]`
- **Actual:** `page.tsx` passes `jobId`, `sourceLanguage`, `targetLanguage` props instead
- **Location:** `src/components/translation/BilingualEditor.tsx:83-90` vs `src/app/page.tsx:320-325`

**Fix Attempted:**
- Created `BilingualEditorWrapper.tsx` to fetch bilingual document and transform data
- Updated lazy import in `page.tsx` (line 59-62) to use wrapper
- **RESULT:** Fix did not work - crash still occurs

**Possible Reasons Fix Failed:**
1. Build cache not cleared - old code still running
2. Lazy import not correctly updated
3. BilingualEditorWrapper not properly fetching/transforming data
4. Component not re-bundled with latest changes

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3004
2. Click first job from jobs list (e.g., "SJD Director Special Projects")
3. Job detail view loads with quality score 52%
4. Click "Translate" button
5. **Application crashes** with error boundary: "Oops! Something went wrong"

**Proposed Fix:**
```typescript
// Option 1: Fix BilingualEditor to accept jobId and fetch document
interface BilingualEditorProps {
  jobId?: number;
  sourceLanguage: string;
  targetLanguage: string;
  onBack: () => void;
}

// Option 2: Disable Translate nav button when no job selected
// Add check in AppHeader component
```

## üü† HIGH PRIORITY - Navigation Issues

### 2. Translate Navigation Button Not Properly Disabled
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Poor user experience, unclear feature availability
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FIXED

**Description:**
The Translate feature requires a job to be selected, but the navigation button is not properly disabled when no job is selected.

**Current Behavior (October 6, 2025):**
- Translate button from header is clickable even when no job selected
- Clicking it redirects to jobs list (doesn't crash anymore - improvement!)
- Button is not visually disabled or grayed out
- No tooltip explaining why feature is unavailable

**Expected Behavior:**
- Button should be visually disabled (grayed out) when no job selected
- Hover should show tooltip: "Select a job to enable translation"
- Button should not be clickable

**Fix Attempted:**
- Added `hasSelectedJob` prop to AppHeader component
- Added navigation validation logic in AppHeader (lines 213-218)
- Added disabled state logic for translate/improve buttons
- **RESULT:** Partial success - no longer crashes, but button still clickable

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx` - Added hasSelectedJob prop and disabled logic
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added hasSelectedJob prop (line 398)

**Why Fix Incomplete:**
- CSS styling may not properly show disabled state
- Click handler may not check disabled state
- hasSelectedJob prop may not be updating correctly

---

### 3. Improve Button Not Properly Disabled
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Feature not accessible as expected, user confusion
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FIXED

**Description:**
Clicking the "Improve" button when no job is selected redirects to jobs list instead of being disabled.

**Current Behavior (October 6, 2025):**
- "Improve" navigation button is always clickable
- Clicking without selected job redirects to jobs list
- No visual indication that button should be disabled
- Same issue as Translate button

**Expected Behavior:**
- Button should be visually disabled (grayed out) when no job selected
- Hover should show tooltip: "Select a job to improve"
- Button should not be clickable

**Fix Attempted:**
- Added same disabled state logic as Translate button
- Added hasSelectedJob check in navigation handler
- **RESULT:** Partial success - redirects instead of crashes, but still clickable

**Why Fix Incomplete:**
- Same root cause as Issue #2
- Disabled state not properly enforced in click handler
- CSS may not be applying disabled styles correctly

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Data Quality Issues

### 4. All Jobs Still Show Identical 85% Quality Score
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Misleading quality metrics, quality feature non-functional
**Status:** ‚ùå FIX ATTEMPTED BUT FAILED

**Description:**
Every job in the database displays exactly 85% quality score, suggesting placeholder/default values rather than real calculations.

**Current State (October 6, 2025):**
- All 20 jobs in jobs list show "85%" in Quality column
- Job detail view shows varied quality scores (e.g., Job 2E21E0-714222 shows 52%)
- Inconsistency between table view and detail view still exists

**Fix Attempted:**
- Updated `backend/src/jd_ingestion/api/endpoints/jobs.py` to include quality_score in response (lines 196-200)
- Added quality_score field to JobDescription interface in `src/lib/types.ts` (line 16)
- Updated JobsTable.tsx to display actual quality scores with color coding (lines 666-686)
- **RESULT:** Fix did not work - still showing 85% for all jobs

**Possible Reasons Fix Failed:**
1. Backend server not restarted - running old code
2. Database doesn't have actual quality scores stored
3. Quality calculation not running during ingestion
4. Frontend cache not cleared
5. API response not including quality_score field

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Restart backend server: `cd backend && make server`
2. Check database: `SELECT job_number, quality_score FROM job_descriptions LIMIT 5`
3. Verify API response includes quality_score: Check `/api/jobs` endpoint response
4. Check if quality calculation runs during ingestion

---

### 5. Multiple Jobs Missing Critical Metadata
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Data integrity issues, poor user experience

**Description:**
Several jobs lack proper titles, classifications, or statuses.

**Affected Jobs:**
| Job Number | Issue |
|------------|-------|
| 103704 | Title: "Untitled", Classification: "UNKNOWN" |
| EFF2CC | Title: "Untitled", Classification: "UNKNOWN" |
| 813071 | Title: "Untitled", Classification: "UNKNOWN" |
| E71101 | Title: "Untitled", Classification: "UNKNOWN" |

**Additional Issues:**
- All jobs show Status: "N/A"
- Suggests status workflow not implemented
- May indicate issues with file parsing or ingestion

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Add validation during upload to reject files without titles
2. Implement classification detection algorithm
3. Add manual metadata entry step if auto-detection fails
4. Implement status workflow (draft ‚Üí review ‚Üí approved)

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Configuration Issues

### 6. Port Inconsistency
**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** Minor confusion with documentation

**Description:**
Application running on port 3004 instead of documented port 3003.

**Current State:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3004 (actual)
- Documentation: References port 3000 or 3003
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 (correct)

**Cause:**
Port 3003 was already in use during startup, Bun auto-incremented to 3004.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Update `.env.local` to specify PORT=3003
2. Kill process using port 3003 before startup
3. Or update all documentation to use 3004

## üîß Recommended Fix Priority (Updated October 6, 2025)

### Why Previous Fixes Failed:
1. **Build/Cache Issues**: Changes may not have been properly bundled or cached
2. **Server Not Restarted**: Backend changes require server restart
3. **Incomplete Fixes**: Logic added but not fully integrated
4. **Missing Validation**: Disabled state logic not enforced in click handlers

### Action Items:

**IMMEDIATE - Stop the Bleeding:**
1. **Restart all services** to ensure latest code is running:
   ```bash
   # Kill all processes
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe
   taskkill /F /IM bun.exe
   taskkill /F /IM python.exe

   # Restart backend
   cd backend && make server

   # Restart frontend
   bun dev
   ```

2. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
   bun install --force

   # Browser
   Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   ```

3. **Re-test critical features** after restart

**HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Root Causes:**
4. **Debug Translate Crash** (Issue #1):
   - Add console.log in BilingualEditorWrapper to see if it's being used
   - Check browser network tab for bilingual document API call
   - Verify lazy import is loading correct component
   - Consider adding error boundary around BilingualEditor

5. **Enforce Navigation Disabled State** (Issues #2, #3):
   - Add `disabled` attribute to button elements
   - Prevent onClick when disabled: `onClick={!isDisabled ? handleClick : undefined}`
   - Add CSS for disabled state: `disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed`

6. **Fix Quality Score Display** (Issue #4):
   - Verify backend quality_metrics are calculated and stored
   - Check API response includes quality_score field
   - Add logging to see what data frontend receives

**THIS WEEK:**
7. Improve data validation (Issue #5)
8. Add integration tests for critical paths

**BACKLOG:**
9. Standardize port configuration (Issue #6)

## 🚧 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Translate tab test failure**
   - Expected: Tab is disabled when no job selected
   - Not a bug: Proper accessibility behavior
   - Fix: Update test to handle disabled state

2. **Color contrast in some disabled states**
   - WCAG does not require contrast for disabled elements
   - Can be enhanced in future iteration

3. **Focus indicators could be more prominent**
   - Current indicators meet WCAG standards
   - Enhancement opportunity for future UX polish

### Known Limitations
1. **Translation memory limited to exact matches**
   - Future: Implement fuzzy matching
   - Future: ML-based similarity scoring

2. **AI features require OpenAI API key**
   - Documented in setup instructions
   - Alternative: Could add local LLM support

3. **File size limit: 50MB per upload**
   - Configurable in BulkUpload component
   - Sufficient for most government job descriptions

## 💰 Budget & Resources

### Development Costs (Estimated)
- **Phase 1-5**: ~6 weeks development
- **Phase 6**: 2 days (bilingual + accessibility)
- **Total Development**: ~8 weeks

### Production Costs (Phase 7 - Estimated)
- **Azure Infrastructure**: ~$470 CAD/month
- **Third-party Services**: ~$35 CAD/month (Sentry)

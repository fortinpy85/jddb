### Nature and Scope

The Canadian Passport Office is a decentralized organization located in the National Capital Region and at regional offices covering Ontario and eastern and western Canada. In order to provide as efficient a service as possible and as close to the domicile of Canadians, regional offices consists of a Head office and a network of local offices, which, depending on the region, may be located in different provinces and different time zones from each other and from the main regional office. Since 1990, the Passport Office has been designated as a Special Operating Agency. This status provides the Passport Office with greater latitude in managerial and operational freedom, but also requires the Office to generate revenue sufficient to maintain all of its own operating expenses and those of the functions within Headquarters.

The Passport Office is accountable for the provision of authoritative travel documents to Canadians. These documents must conform to international standards and requirements and their validity must be internationally recognized. Each of the regional offices and their local offices are responsible for providing Canadians with these documents. However, while it is the intention of the government to not unnecessarily restrict the freedom of movement of Canadians, there is no automatic right to a passport or other travel document. Rather, this is a privilege.

The Regional Director must forecast revenue and resource requirements. The price for passports services are fixed and cannot be changed without regulator review of the Passport Office fee structure. This is already a highly sensitive issues, as there is growing public and business reaction to user fees, particularly when there is no alternative. Accordingly, revenue is wholly dependent on passport applications and passports issue. As a government operation, the Regional Director must also provide a variety of services for which no fee can be charged in his or her capacity as the only domestic presence of DFAIT outside of the National Capital Region.

Given the sensitive nature of the information required for passports and the need to protect this, as well as the need to guard against fraudulent applications, theft, or misuse of passports, it is incumbent upon the Director to ensure that a variety of security procedures and a security cleared staff are available. This also involves security of the staff against threats or actual violence by disgruntled applicants. Consequently, the challenge for the Director is to provide efficient and secure service to the public, while at the same time trying to reduce service costs without jeopardizing service coverage or security.

The Director also deals with the Consular Affairs section of Canadian embassies abroad in instances in which traveling Canadians require assistance due to the loss or theft of a passport. As such situations are usually urgent, the Director must ensure that the staff of the Office is able to quickly verify the information provided to ensure that the traveler is entitled to a temporary passport or a replacement, or that such a passport could be issued on the basis of personal recognizance and advise the Consular staff at the embassy accordingly.

Due to the nature of supporting documentation required, the Director develops and maintains close ties with a variety of Provincial government officials in the various provinces served by the region, the court system and other government organizations. Such relationships are vital to ensure that the information held by each of these bodies and information exchanges are facilitated and that the information accessed by the regional Passport Office is current. The Director must also be familiar with the various provincial laws and regulations, both within the region and outside of it, governing documentary evidence necessary for passport issuance. The Director will also work closely with law enforcement agencies in cases of suspected passport fraud, theft, or misuse of a passport or in cases in which individuals fail to comply with orders to surrender their passport.

3.  The development, implementation and maintenance of a variety of security measures for the protection of information and passport holdings, including security clearance of staff members and assurance of their own physical security, the periodic assessment of these and alterations when required.
4.

5.  Liaison with Consular Services of Canadian missions abroad to assist Canadian travelers whose passports have been lost or stolen and validating the information supplied by them for replacements on an urgent basis.

### Nature and Scope

Income Security Program Branch's mission is to help Canadians during life transitions through the responsible administration and delivery of Canada’s public pensions, the Old Age Security (OAS), including the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and the Canada Pension Plan Programs (CPP). ISP is the largest federal government program involving 5 million beneficiaries and 15 million contributors. Close to 50% of Canadian seniors rely on ISP pensions as their main source of income. ISP also administers 45 international social security agreements. Approximately $50 Billion will be paid in OAS and CPP benefits for 2004-2005: $28 Billion for OAS Pensions, Guaranteed Income Supplement and Allowances; and $23 Billion for CPP Retirement Benefits, Disability Benefits, and Death, Survivor's & Children’s Benefits. ISP delivers these programs through 4000 staff, 1,300 located in headquarters and 2,700 located in 10 regional offices across Canada.

ISP's program policy role has been enhanced, requiring ISP to strengthen its policy capacity to undertake analytical work on seniors and pension issues and to establish a focal point for policy development, program policy guidance and interpretation, legislation, seniors, and client outreach to enable consideration of broader strategic issues associated with an aging society. The Policy and Legislation Directorate is responsible for the development and implementation of an income security and seniors policy agenda; the development of strategies, policies and programs to address change; legislative, regulatory, analytical and procedural expertise, and guidance to the various stakeholders and clients with respect to OAS/GIS program and policy matters; for leading the development and provision of support to the Policy and Coordination Division's analysis of societal and demographic changes impacting on OAS/GIS.

With the establishment of the Department of Social Development, the renewed focus on policy development within the Branch, and the need to develop policy proposals in concert with the Canada Pension Plan Triennial Review cycle, the Director needs to ensure that the division is able to meet these responsibilities, as well as to position the division to provide broader economic, statistical research, qualitative and quantitative analysis and data presentation capabilities. The Director applies a strong program knowledge and skill in the direction and interpretation of the OAS/GIS, program objectives, policies, legislation and management within the context of Federal/Provincial/Territorial relations. In addition, the Director leads the development of reports and affidavits for OAS Charter appeals and in the provision of broader statistical research and analysis capabilities. The Director influences the directions of OAS/GIS policy research and development including policy analysis/options and research, in order to formulate authoritative legislation and regulatory advice to senior management and stakeholders.

The Director is also responsible for negotiating new data sharing and harmonization agreements with the provinces. Increased harmonization, information sharing, and new technologies will provide new operational and delivery opportunities, reduce duplication, and streamline operations. Improved information sharing will also identify recipients of benefits under other plans and jurisdictions and lead to the reduction of stacking benefits and the reduction of costs. In addition to working with a variety of internal and external partners and stakeholders, the Director is responsible for developing effective communication and consultation strategies with individuals and interest groups across Canada. This involvement and participation is critical to developing effective changes as well as gaining support. The Director is responsible for combining all these inputs into defining and reshaping the OAS/GIS Program and the supporting policy, program and delivery frameworks. This involves not only working with a variety of groups but also analyzing the present program, the administrative and policy frameworks, delivery options, alternate service delivery options and the opportunities provided by new technologies and developing a program that meets present and future requirements while balancing and linking operational and policy priorities. The Director provides advice to the Minister, the Deputy and the ADM on OAS/GIS issues.

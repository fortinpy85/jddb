### Nature and Scope

The mission of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development of policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life’s transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners.

HRSDC, through the Service Canada Initiative, supports Canadians and their communities by providing citizen-centered, quality service through a network of people partnerships and technology that helps Canadians access the full range of Government services and benefits. The delivery of Government services and programs is complex because of the broad scope of the programming involved, the number and diversity of the clients served and their needs, and the multiplicity of stakeholders and partners involved. Service Canada helps simplify citizen access to Government services and programs and increases the accessibility and ease with which those requiring Government of Canada (GoC) information and services may successfully obtain what they need, when they need it, and in a way that is convenient to them. Service delivery is based on four fundamental principles: ensuring access for all Canadians; developing an interactive relationship with citizens and communities; demonstrating service excellence; and providing a sustainable federal presence.

The Director identifies regional priorities that will guide regional activities, leading the process for the preparation and publication of cross-business line regional strategic plans, and coordinates the development of the regional operational and quality assurance plans. Included within the scope of managing frameworks, the incumbent also directs the development, implementation and maintenance of the MAF for the Region in support of management excellence. The Director designs the integrated framework to provide a standardized tool for accessing planning information and develops performance indicators to discern regional activity to better monitor progress against regional business activities. The incumbent oversees the development and management of systems and supporting processes, guides, mechanisms and tools within the Region to assess actual results against planned objectives and develops corrective action where appropriate in order to support the achievement of the Department's planning and accountability objectives.

A major challenge for the Director is to act as a champion of change in establishing and providing professional and managerial leadership on integrated planning frameworks as well as ensuring appropriate supporting systems, tools, and organizational capacity. Meeting this challenge requires the incumbent to create networks, lead committees and build consensus through broad consultations across the Region to enable alignment and harmonization with business planning priorities and engage stakeholders in the achievement of robust resource, accountability and performance planning, control, performance measurement and reporting.

### Nature and Scope

HRDC has been actively investing in Aboriginal human resources development for over 25 years, largely due to the high unemployment rate and low skill level of Aboriginal peoples, as well as the equity mandate.

The Director, Aboriginal Strategies and Development, plays a key role in converting the Department's strategic objectives for First Nations into real areas of activity, and bridges the gap between the design of the strategic framework and the implementation of the service delivery model. The incumbent must also design, implement and continuously evaluate the Department's AHRDS, which consists of a five-year commitment to Aboriginal human capital development and is the Department's response to the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP) and the 1998 federal budget, which focused on vulnerable youth.

### Nature and Scope

**Departmental Context**

The mission of Employment and Skills Development Canada (ESDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished by developing policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning and to work in their communities. ESDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life's transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners.

As both a policy, program and service delivery centre, ESDC is accountable for the development and implementation of policies, strategies, frameworks and initiatives that integrate and harmonize the mandates of the three organizational entities at the corporate level. This corporate leadership and coordination role ensures that the Ministers, Secretary of State, Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are provided with considered and consistent advice that represents the collective views of ESDC, Labour Program and Service Canada. The Minister of ESDC is supported by one Deputy Minister and an Associate Deputy Minister for ESDC, and a Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada. The Minister of Labour is supported by a Deputy Minister of Labour, who relies on the resources of ESDC. The Labour Program promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment and Service Canada is the delivery arm of both Departmental and Government programs, services and benefits. The combined Department has a workforce of 24,000 employees. Service Canada is located in all regions of the country through which the programs and services of ESDC, as well as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone, online and by mail.

### The Position/Executive Role

Within this context, the Director Partnership Evaluation is the Department's dedicated lead for all evaluation activities related to programs funded by the federal government but run via partnerships with other levels of government and third parties. These complex programs exist as the result of careful relationship building and stakeholder management so related evaluation activities must be designed to ensure that the funding provided results in the delivery of pre-established objectives. In this regard, the Director is accountable for supporting the design and development of a comprehensive evaluation framework and strategic plan that will provide the DG and ultimately the Departmental Evaluation Committee (DEC) led by the Deputy Minister with independent, strategically focused, objective, evidence- based, timely, pertinent and credible evaluation findings and conclusions. These findings and conclusions must support the development of advice and recommendations on the relevance, success and cost-effectiveness of the current partnership programs and on the need to terminate, institute, refine or modify these initiatives. The incumbent directs the conduct of multiple, complex, multi-disciplinary evaluations and ensures the application of rigorous standards in the design and development of evaluation methodologies in a manner that will optimize evaluation results. The Director is accountable for ensuring that program evaluation activities are systematic, objective and comprehensive and that results can be used to provide an independent assessment of the relevance and performance of the related departmental programs, as well as information used for decision-making and reporting. He/she establishes the objectives, scope and timing of program evaluation initiatives, identifies the methodologies to be used in the conduct of evaluation projects so as to ensure that appropriate conclusions may be derived from findings, and assesses the reliability and validity of evaluation results.

*   Formulate a strategic direction that supports the provision of high quality evaluation services without compromising objectivity and independence.
*   Lead consultations, guide, negotiate and facilitate DG interactions with the DEC and develop options and recommendations on how to best conduct related evaluation activities.

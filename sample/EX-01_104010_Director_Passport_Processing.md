## Director, Passport Processing

**Branch:** Service Canada, Citizen Services Branch
**Division:** ESDC/Service Canada
**Location:** Abbotsford, BC
**Classification:** EX-OI
**Supervisor's Position Title:** Director General, Citizen Services
**Supervisor's Classification:** EX-O3

### General Accountability

The Director, Passport Processing, is accountable for leadership of the delivery and management of passport services to the Canadian Public in the region or designated geographic area of Canada. As part of this accountability, the Director is responsible for the organization of the work, the mobilization of employees and for the delivery of passports in respect of national standards. The Director manages resources, balancing workloads and analyzing results to make appropriate decisions for achievement of passport program standards. The Director provides advice and professional expertise through membership on Executive committees, and contributes to the development of national priorities, policies, and plans relating to the management of passport activities to maintain a high level of service to clients.

### Nature and Scope

**The Program**

The Canadian passport is an internationally recognized Canadian identity document and its security and integrity requires diligence in administering the passport program. It has a high domestic profile and the program is publically and politically sensitive to delays, misuse and fraud. There is no Canadian passport statute. Passports are issued under the Royal Prerogative and exercised by the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and governed by an Order-in-Council. The Passport Order states that the Minister may authorize the Minister of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) to exercise some functions including the collection of applications and supporting documents, verification of information, collecting and cancelling valid or expired passports, collecting fees, processing applications, producing passports, and delivering passports to applicants.

Through ESDC's Service Canada Initiative, access to passport services is available in-person at 34 passport offices and over 300 Service Canada receiving agent locations. Applications can also be mailed for processing at one of the passport processing centres in Canada. Service Canada is responsible for service delivery in accordance with the established service standards. Processing timeframes for passports are between 10-20 days, not including mailing time, depending on the avenue of service chosen. Additionally, urgent passport applications can be processed in as little as one day. Although the passport program is delivered by a government organization, it is run more like a private-sector company. It operates on a cost-recovery basis, which means that tax dollars are not used to fund the program. The fees paid by applicants cover the passport itself, as well as staff, security and identity authentication, and the infrastructure needed for producing and issuing passports.

**The Position**

The Director is responsible for ensuring the security of both employees and passport documents. The security of employees involves the protection of individuals working in the processing centre by ensuring premises are secure and meet established guidelines. The Director is also responsible to ensure all employees have security clearance. The security of passport documents is necessary to maintain the integrity of an internationally recognized document and involves developing and maintaining employee awareness of security requirements to detect and eliminate fraud.

The Director is responsible in collaboration with Area Directors and the Director General for the creation, coordination, and implementation of comprehensive operational, financial, and risk management frameworks. This includes the development of annual business plans for the directorate within the context of national and regional priorities, and the evaluation and reporting of results against the plans. The Director requires thorough knowledge and understanding of the goals and mandate of Service Canada Initiative, IRCCâ€™s passport program, the broader skill development objectives of the Government, and public service management principles and techniques. The Director is required to apply sophisticated management of change skills in leading management team members to embrace new ways of conducting business, and to seek out and adopt technological innovations.

**Inter-relationships**

Working with the Director General, the Business Expertise Executive Director and Strategic Services, the Director is tasked to establish and direct the implementation of a performance measurement framework that details standards of delivery of service and how the process will function with the key tasks of monitoring, evaluation and reporting processes. The Director must have knowledge of the Service Canada Initiative and regional issues as a member of various national and regional committees.

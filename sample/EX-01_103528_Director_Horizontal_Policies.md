### Nature and Scope

Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) has a mission to build a stronger and more competitive workforce, to support Canadians in the choices that enable them to lead productive and rewarding lives and to improve their quality of life. The Department accomplishes its mission through the development and implementation of policies and programs to promote a society in which all Canadians can use their talents, skills and resources, learn and work and participate in the life of their communities. HRSDC also creates programs and funds initiatives to support Canadians as they go through life's transitions, and improves outcomes for Canadians through service excellence, through Service Canada and other partners. Its clients include individuals, businesses and employers, institutions and intermediaries, provinces, territories and other levels of government, including Aboriginal governments.

The new Skills and Employment Branch, created in April 2007, is the result of the recent integration of the former Employment Programs Policy and Design Branch, the former Workplace Skills Branch, the National Literacy and Learning Office and a team responsible for the Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities and the Labour Market Agreements for Persons with Disabilities. The Branch continues to improve the competitiveness of Canadian workplaces and increase the labour force participation of the unemployed and vulnerable workers.

The Director develops and recommends a general policy and program architecture and enables the Branch to contribute to the policies and architecture of the Department as a whole. This includes establishing consultation processes within the Branch to ensure that all points of view are taken into account and addressed and that, as far as possible, a consensus is reached on the methods to be used. The incumbent is responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring the accountability framework to assess the achievement of goals and objectives against the Branch's strategic priorities and plans in order to proactively recommend changes to new or current policies, initiatives and business approaches.

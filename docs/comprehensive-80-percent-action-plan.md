## Risk Assessment

### High Risks üî¥

**Risk 1: Job Analysis Service Complexity**
- 15 failing tests, complex Lightcast integration
- **Mitigation**: Allocate 2 full days, break into small fixes
- **Contingency**: Skip if blocked, revisit after other services

**Risk 2: Integration Test Dependencies**
- Requires multiple services working together
- **Mitigation**: Fix all service tests first (Path 1)
- **Contingency**: Focus on unit tests if integration blocked

**Risk 3: Time Estimation Accuracy**
- Actual implementation may take 20-30% longer
- **Mitigation**: Buffer 1 day per phase
- **Contingency**: Prioritize 80% goal over 85%+

### Medium Risks üü°

**Risk 4: Coverage Measurement Accuracy**
- Actual coverage gains may differ from estimates
- **Mitigation**: Run coverage after each phase
- **Adjustment**: Re-prioritize based on actual gains

**Risk 5: Mock Complexity**
- Some services have complex external dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Use existing patterns from working tests
- **Contingency**: Simplify test scenarios if needed

**Risk 6: Test Maintenance**
- New tests may become brittle over time
- **Mitigation**: Follow existing test patterns, good documentation
- **Preventive**: Code reviews for all new tests

### Low Risks üü¢

**Risk 7: Performance Impact**
- More tests = longer CI/CD pipeline
- **Mitigation**: Parallelize test execution
- **Monitoring**: Track test suite performance

# Skills Intelligence Tests - Fix Summary

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Result**: All 5 active tests now passing (4 skipped tests are expected)
**Previous State**: 0/9 passing → **Current State**: 5/5 passing

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Backend API Missing Skills Data
**Problem**: `/api/jobs` endpoint did not include skills array in response
**Impact**: Frontend skills filter UI never rendered (`availableSkills.length === 0`)
**Location**: `backend/src/jd_ingestion/api/endpoints/jobs.py`

### 2. Frontend Lazy Loading Timing
**Problem**: Tests navigated to Jobs tab but JobsTable component didn't render (lazy loading issue)
**Impact**: Tests timed out looking for job titles
**Location**: `tests/skills.spec.ts` beforeEach hook

### 3. Test Selector Issues
**Problem**: "Python" text appeared in both file path and skills badge (strict mode violation)
**Impact**: Test 1 failed with "resolved to 2 elements"
**Location**: `tests/skills.spec.ts` test 1

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Backend API - Add Skills to Response
**File**: `backend/src/jd_ingestion/api/endpoints/jobs.py`

**Changes**:
1. Added `selectinload(JobDescription.skills)` to query (line 102)
2. Added skills array with confidence scores to each job in response (lines 202-254)

```python
# Load skills relationship
base_query = select(JobDescription).options(
    selectinload(JobDescription.quality_metrics),
    selectinload(JobDescription.skills),  # ADDED
)

# ... later in response building ...

# Add skills with confidence scores
if job.skills:
    skills_query = select(
        job_description_skills.c.skill_id,
        job_description_skills.c.confidence,
    ).where(job_description_skills.c.job_id == job.id)

    skills_result = await db.execute(skills_query)
    skill_confidence_map = {row[0]: row[1] for row in skills_result.fetchall()}

    job_data["skills"] = [
        {
            "id": skill.id,
            "lightcast_id": skill.lightcast_id,
            "name": skill.name,
            "skill_type": skill.skill_type,
            "category": skill.category,
            "confidence": skill_confidence_map.get(skill.id, 0.0),
        }
        for skill in job.skills
    ]
else:
    job_data["skills"] = []
```

**Verification**: API now returns:
```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": 11,
      "job_number": "123456",
      "title": "Senior Python Developer",
      "skills": [
        {
          "id": 4,
          "name": "Python",
          "confidence": 0.95
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "name": "Project Management",
          "confidence": 0.87
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fix 2: Frontend Tests - Wait for Lazy Loading
**File**: `tests/skills.spec.ts`

**Changes**: Updated beforeEach hook (lines 4-11)

```typescript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  // Use real API with seeded database
  await page.goto("/");
  // Wait for React SPA to fully hydrate and lazy components to load
  await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");  // CHANGED from waitForTimeout(2000)
  await page.waitForTimeout(1000);
});
```

**Why This Works**: `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` waits for all network requests (including lazy-loaded components) to complete, ensuring JobsTable is fully rendered before tests interact with it.

---

### Fix 3: Test 1 - Fix Selector for Skills Display
**File**: `tests/skills.spec.ts`

**Changes**: Updated test 1 skill assertions (lines 23-34)

**Before** (❌ Failed):
```typescript
await expect(page.getByRole("status").filter({ hasText: "Python" })).toBeVisible();
```

**After** (✅ Works):
```typescript
const skillsContainer = page.locator("div").filter({ hasText: /^Extracted Skills/ });
await expect(skillsContainer.getByText("Python")).toBeVisible();
await expect(skillsContainer.getByText("95%")).toBeVisible();
```

**Why This Works**: Skills are rendered in a `<div>` container (not `<section>`), and scoping the search to the skills container avoids matching "Python" in the file path.

---

## Backend Restart Required

**Critical Note**: Backend auto-reload did NOT detect the jobs.py changes. Manual restart was required:

```bash
# Kill old backend process
cd backend && poetry run uvicorn jd_ingestion.api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Recommendation**: Always manually restart backend after significant endpoint changes to ensure changes take effect.

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
```
0 passed, 5 failed, 4 skipped (9 total)
```

### After Fixes
```
✅ 5 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped (9 total)

Tests Passing:
✅ Test 1: should display skills on job detail page
✅ Test 6: should filter jobs by selected skills
✅ Test 7: should clear individual skill filters
✅ Test 8: should clear all skill filters
✅ Test 9: should integrate with other filters

Tests Skipped (Expected):
⏭️ Test 2: should handle jobs with no skills (requires job without skills in DB)
⏭️ Test 3: should expand/collapse many skills (requires job with 15+ skills)
⏭️ Test 4: should display Skills Analytics tab (UI timing issue)
⏭️ Test 5: should handle empty skills data (requires empty DB)
```

## Files Modified

1. **backend/src/jd_ingestion/api/endpoints/jobs.py** (lines 100-254)
   - Added skills to query with `selectinload()`
   - Added skills array to API response with confidence scores

2. **tests/skills.spec.ts** (lines 4-11, 23-34)
   - Fixed lazy loading wait strategy
   - Fixed skills selector to use div container

---

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes:

1. **Verify API returns skills**:
```bash
curl -L -s "http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/?skip=5&limit=2" | python -m json.tool
```

2. **Run skills tests**:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/skills.spec.ts --project=chromium --reporter=list
```

Expected: All 5 active tests pass, 4 skipped

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Backend Auto-Reload Limitations**: uvicorn's `--reload` flag may not detect all file changes. Always verify API responses after changes.

2. **Lazy Loading in Tests**: React lazy() components require `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` not fixed timeouts.

3. **API-First Testing**: Using real API data (not mocks) revealed the actual bug - missing skills in API response.

4. **Selector Specificity**: Always scope selectors to avoid strict mode violations when text appears in multiple places.

## Future Improvements

### Test Infrastructure
- Add database fixture system for skipped tests (jobs without skills, jobs with many skills)
- Add API response validation to catch missing data earlier

### Backend
- Add integration tests for `/api/jobs` endpoint to verify skills are included
- Consider adding `include_skills` query parameter for performance optimization

### Frontend
- Consider adding loading indicators for lazy-loaded components
- Add error boundary for skills data fetch failures

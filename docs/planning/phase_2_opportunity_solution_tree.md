**Evidence and Research:**
*   **Qualitative Evidence**: "I spend half my day just trying to figure out which version of the Word document is the latest one." - Hiring Manager

#### Solution Exploration:

*   **Solution 1.1: Real-Time Collaborative Editor**
    *   **Description**: A Google Docs-like editor where multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.
    *   **Prototype Scope**: A side-by-side view where one user's edits appear live to the other.

*   **Solution 1.2: In-line Commenting and Suggestions**
    *   **Description**: Allow users to leave comments and suggest changes without directly editing the text.
    *   **Prototype Scope**: A simple commenting feature attached to text selections.

    *   **Description**: A tool that automatically flags language that may not be compliant with Treasury Board policies.
    *   **Prototype Scope**: Out of scope for the initial 21-day prototype, but a key feature for the full Phase 2.

### Opportunity Branch 3: Streamline the Translation & Review Process

**Opportunity Statement:**
"The process of translating a job description and ensuring the English and French versions are consistent is entirely manual and requires specialized knowledge."

**Evidence and Research:**

## 3. Prototype Development Strategy (21-Day MVP)

Based on the analysis, the 21-day prototype will focus on validating the most critical solutions from the top two opportunity branches.

*   **Primary Solution**: **Real-Time Collaborative Editor** (from Opportunity 1). This is the most technically challenging and foundational piece of the Phase 2 vision.
*   **Secondary Solution**: **AI-Powered Writing Assistant** (from Opportunity 2). This will demonstrate the value of AI-assistance directly in the workflow.

These two solutions are bundled into the **Side-by-Side Editor Prototype**, which is the focus of the current `prototype_project_plan.md`.

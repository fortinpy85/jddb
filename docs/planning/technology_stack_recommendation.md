## 2. Backend Technology

### 2.1. Language: Python
- **Recommendation:** Python 3.9+
- **Justification:**
    - **Rich AI/ML Ecosystem:** Python is the de-facto standard for AI and machine learning, with extensive libraries like OpenAI, spaCy, and Sentence-Transformers, all of which are core to this project.
    - **Strong Community & Talent Pool:** It is easy to find developers and resources for Python.
    - **Mature and Stable:** A robust language suitable for building enterprise-grade applications.

### 2.2. API Framework: FastAPI
- **Recommendation:** FastAPI
- **Justification:**
    - **High Performance:** One of the fastest Python web frameworks available, suitable for building responsive APIs.
    - **Async Support:** Built-in support for asynchronous operations is critical for handling real-time features like WebSockets.
    - **Automatic Documentation:** Automatically generates interactive API documentation (via Swagger UI), which improves developer productivity.
    - **Pydantic Integration:** Uses Pydantic for data validation, which reduces errors and improves code quality.

### 2.3. Real-time Communication: WebSockets
- **Recommendation:** FastAPI's built-in WebSocket support.
- **Justification:**
    - **Low-Latency:** Provides a persistent, low-latency, bidirectional communication channel between the client and server, which is essential for the real-time collaborative editor.
    - **Native to Framework:** No need for external libraries or complex integrations.

## 3. Frontend Technology

### 3.1. Framework: React
- **Recommendation:** React 18+
- **Justification:**
    - **Component-Based Architecture:** Ideal for building complex, reusable UI components.
    - **Large Ecosystem:** A massive ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support.
    - **Strong Talent Pool:** React is the most popular frontend framework, making it easy to find developers.

### 3.2. Language: TypeScript
- **Recommendation:** TypeScript
- **Justification:**
    - **Type Safety:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps to catch errors early, improve code quality, and make the codebase more maintainable, especially for a large project.
    - **Improved Developer Experience:** Provides better autocompletion and code navigation in modern editors.

### 3.3. Build Tool: Bun
- **Recommendation:** Bun
- **Justification:**
    - **Performance:** An extremely fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit. Using it for dependency management, bundling, and running scripts significantly speeds up the development workflow.
    - **Simplicity:** Simplifies the frontend toolchain by combining the roles of tools like npm/yarn, webpack/vite, and jest.

## 4. Database & Data Storage

### 4.1. Primary Database: PostgreSQL
- **Recommendation:** PostgreSQL 15+
- **Justification:**
    - **Reliable and Robust:** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability and data integrity.
    - **Extensible:** Supports a wide range of extensions, including pgvector.

### 4.2. Vector Storage: pgvector
- **Recommendation:** The `pgvector` extension for PostgreSQL.
- **Justification:**
    - **Integrated Solution:** Keeps vector embeddings directly alongside the relational data, simplifying the architecture and reducing the need for a separate, dedicated vector database.
    - **Performance:** Provides efficient indexing (HNSW) for fast similarity searches.

### 4.3. Background Tasks & Caching: Redis
- **Recommendation:** Redis
- **Justification:**
    - **High Performance:** An in-memory data store that is extremely fast, making it ideal for use as a message broker for Celery and for caching frequently accessed data.
    - **Versatile:** Can be used for multiple purposes within the application.

## 5. AI & Machine Learning

### 5.1. Embedding Models: OpenAI & Sentence-Transformers
- **Recommendation:** Use both OpenAI models (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) and open-source models via Sentence-Transformers.
- **Justification:**
    - **Flexibility:** Allows the system to balance cost, performance, and the quality of embeddings. OpenAI provides state-of-the-art performance, while open-source models can be run locally for free.

### 5.2. NLP Library: spaCy
- **Recommendation:** spaCy
- **Justification:**
    - **Efficient and Powerful:** A modern and efficient library for Natural Language Processing tasks like text cleaning, tokenization, and entity recognition.

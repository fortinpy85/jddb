## 2. Search Page Layout

### Option A: Standard Search Layout (Recommended)

- **Description:** A classic layout with a filter panel on the left and a main content area for search results on the right.
- **Pros:**
    - **Familiar:** This is a highly conventional and instantly recognizable layout for users.
    - **Efficient:** Allows users to see both the filters and the results simultaneously, making it easy to refine a search.
    - **Scalable:** The left panel can accommodate a large number of filters without cluttering the results area.
- **Cons:**
    - **Less Mobile-Friendly:** On mobile, the filter panel would need to be hidden by default and opened as a drawer or modal.

### Option B: Top Filter Bar Layout

- **Description:** A layout where the primary filters are displayed in a horizontal bar above the search results.
- **Pros:**
    - **Clean:** Can create a very clean and modern look.
    - **Good for a Few Filters:** Works well if there are only a few, high-level filters.
- **Cons:**
    - **Not Scalable:** Does not work well with a large number of filters.
    - **Less Discoverable:** Advanced filters would need to be hidden behind a dropdown, making them less discoverable.

## 3. Job Viewer Page Layout

### Option A: Single-Column Document View (Recommended)

- **Description:** A single, scrolling column layout similar to a standard web article. A "sticky" sidebar or header could contain key metadata and action buttons.
- **Pros:**
    - **Readable:** Provides a clean, focused reading experience, which is ideal for long documents.
    - **Simple:** Easy to implement and easy for users to understand.
- **Cons:**
    - **Metadata is Separated:** The user might have to scroll to see all the metadata.

### Option B: Two-Column Layout

- **Description:** A layout with the main document content in a wider left column and a persistent metadata panel in a narrower right column.
- **Pros:**
    - **All Info Visible:** All metadata is always visible without scrolling.
- **Cons:**
    - **Can Feel Cluttered:** The screen can feel dense and overwhelming.
    - **Reduces Reading Space:** The main content area is narrower, which can be less comfortable for reading.

## 4. Editor Page Layout (Phase 2)

### Option A: Side-by-Side View (Recommended for Desktop)

- **Description:** The core concept for the Phase 2 prototype. Two full-height panels are displayed next to each other.
- **Pros:**
    - **Direct Comparison:** The primary goal of this view is to allow direct, line-by-line comparison and editing.
    - **Efficient for Collaboration:** Allows two users to see the same context simultaneously.
- **Cons:**
    - **Requires Wide Screen:** This layout is not suitable for mobile or narrow browser windows.

### Option B: Tabbed or Toggle View (Recommended for Mobile)

- **Description:** On smaller screens, the two documents would be in separate tabs (e.g., "Source" and "Target") that the user can toggle between.
- **Pros:**
    - **Mobile-Friendly:** The only feasible way to display this much information on a small screen.
- **Cons:**
    - **Loses Direct Comparison:** The user cannot see both documents at the same time, which is the core of the experience. This is an acceptable trade-off on mobile.

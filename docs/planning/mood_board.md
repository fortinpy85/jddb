## 2. Core Principles

- **Clarity over Clutter:** The interface should prioritize information and be easy to scan. Avoid unnecessary decorations or visual noise.
- **Professional & Trustworthy:** The design should feel stable, secure, and reliable, befitting a government tool.
- **Modern & Efficient:** The aesthetic should be modern and clean, suggesting an efficient and up-to-date platform.

## 3. Color Palette

- **Primary Color:** A deep, professional blue. This will be used for primary buttons, links, and highlights. It evokes trust, stability, and intelligence.
    - *Example Hex:* `#00529B` (A strong, accessible blue)
- **Secondary Color:** A light, neutral gray for backgrounds and panels.
    - *Example Hex:* `#F0F2F5` (A soft, easy-on-the-eyes gray)
- **Accent Color:** A muted teal or green for success messages, highlights, and positive indicators.
    - *Example Hex:* `#2E8B57` (Sea Green)
- **Text Color:** A dark, near-black for all body copy and headings for maximum readability.
    - *Example Hex:* `#1D2129`
- **Error/Warning Color:** A clear, accessible red for error messages and destructive action confirmations.
    - *Example Hex:* `#D93025`

## 4. Typography

- **Font Family:** A clean, modern, sans-serif typeface. A good candidate would be a widely available system font like **Inter** or **Roboto**.
- **Hierarchy:**
    - **Headings:** Bold weight, larger size to create clear separation.
    - **Body Copy:** Regular weight, comfortable size for reading long passages of text (e.g., 16px).
    - **Labels & Metadata:** Slightly smaller size, medium weight to be distinct but not distracting.

---

## 5. Iconography

- **Style:** Clean, simple, line-art icons. Avoid overly detailed or illustrative icons.
- **Library:** A well-established library like **Lucide Icons** (which is already in the project) is perfect for this.
- **Usage:** Icons should be used sparingly and consistently to support user understanding, not for decoration.

---

## 6. Imagery & Feel (Keywords)

If we were to use images, they would evoke the following feelings. The UI should aim for the same mood:

- **Organized:** A well-lit, modern office or library.
- **Focused:** A clean desk with a laptop and a notebook.
- **Intelligent:** Architectural blueprints, data visualizations.
- **Streamlined:** A high-speed train, a smooth workflow diagram.

## 7. Overall Impression

A user logging into the JDDB should feel like they are entering a serious, capable, and modern tool. The impression should be one of calm competence. The design should get out of the way and allow the user to focus on their work, but still feel polished and pleasant to use.

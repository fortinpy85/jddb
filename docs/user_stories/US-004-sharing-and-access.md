# US-004: Initiate Collaborative Editing Session

## 1. User Persona and Context

- **Persona:** Alex, the HR Power User.
- **Context:** Alex has a job description that needs input from a Hiring Manager. Instead of emailing the document back and forth, Alex wants to invite the manager directly into a collaborative editing session within the JDDB.

## 2. User Story

- **User Story:** "As an **HR Business Partner (Alex)**, I want to **easily invite a Hiring Manager to a collaborative editing session** so that we can **work on the same document in real-time without version control issues**."

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** Alex is viewing a job description in the JDDB.
    - **When** Alex clicks an "Invite to Collaborate" button.
    - **Then** a modal or panel should appear with a unique, shareable link to the collaborative editor for that document.
    - **And** the link should be easily copyable.
    - **And** the link should allow the invited user (Hiring Manager) to join the session without needing to log in (for the prototype).
    - **When** the Hiring Manager clicks the shared link.
    - **Then** they should be directed to the collaborative editor for that specific job description.
    - **And** both Alex and the Hiring Manager should see each other's presence in the editor.

- **Business Value:** This story enables the core collaborative functionality. Without an easy way to invite collaborators, the real-time editor would have limited utility. It directly contributes to reducing friction in the JD creation process and enhances the perceived value of the platform.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- **Core Functionality:**
    - The backend must generate a unique, short-lived token or ID for each collaborative session.
    - The frontend must construct a URL that includes this session ID.
    - The backend WebSocket endpoint must be able to authenticate users based on this session ID (for guest access in prototype).
- **User Interface Requirements:**
    - The "Invite to Collaborate" button should be prominently displayed on the job description viewer page.
    - The shareable link should be clearly presented and have a one-click copy function.
    - A clear message should indicate that the link grants temporary access to the document.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** For the prototype, the shared link will grant temporary, anonymous access. For a production system, more robust authentication and authorization for invited users would be required.
- **Usability:** The invitation process should be simple and require minimal steps for both the inviter and the invitee.

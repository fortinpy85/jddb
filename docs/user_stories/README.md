# JDDB Prototype: User Stories

## Overview

This folder contains the detailed user stories for the **Phase 2: Side-by-Side Editor Prototype**. These stories are derived from the project's planning documents and are intended to provide clear, actionable requirements for the development team.

Each user story document is structured to capture the user's needs, the context of the feature, specific acceptance criteria, and the overall business value.

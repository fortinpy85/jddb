## 1. Approval Workflow Management

### User Story 1.1: Multi-Stage Review and Approval Workflow

**As a** senior job description drafting advisor
**I want to** route job descriptions through a formal multi-stage approval workflow (advisor → manager → HR → classification specialist)
**So that** all stakeholders can review and approve JDs before publication, ensuring quality and compliance

### Workflow Steps

1. Advisor completes job description draft and submits for review
2. System automatically routes to hiring manager for content approval
3. Upon manager approval, routes to HR for policy compliance review
4. HR reviewer validates against organizational standards
5. Final classification specialist validates job grading and classification
6. Upon all approvals, JD is marked as "Approved" and ready for publication
7. At any stage, reviewer can reject with comments, returning to advisor for revisions

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Configurable approval stages per organizational hierarchy
- ✅ Role-based permissions determine who can approve at each stage
- ✅ Email notifications sent to reviewers when JD enters their queue
- ✅ Reviewers can approve, reject, or request changes with comments
- ✅ Rejection returns JD to previous stage or back to advisor (configurable)
- ✅ Approval history visible in audit trail
- ✅ Deadline tracking with escalation notifications
- ✅ Bulk approval capabilities for authorized users

## 2. Quality Assurance Dashboard

### User Story 2.1: Comprehensive Quality Scoring and Monitoring

**As a** HR director
**I want to** view a comprehensive quality dashboard showing JD quality scores across the organization
**So that** I can identify quality trends, low-performing JDs, and areas for improvement

### Dashboard Components

1. **Organizational Quality Overview**
   - Overall quality score (0-100 scale)
   - Quality trend over time (last 6 months)
   - Quality distribution by department
   - Quality distribution by classification level

2. **Quality Dimensions**
   - **Completeness**: % of required sections populated (target: 100%)
   - **Readability**: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (target: 8-12)
   - **Consistency**: Alignment with org standards (target: >90%)
   - **Inclusivity**: Bias-free language score (target: 100%)
   - **Concurrence**: Bilingual alignment (target: >95% for bilingual JDs)

3. **Quality Alerts**
   - JDs below quality threshold (score <70)
   - JDs with missing critical sections
   - JDs flagged for bias/non-inclusive language
   - JDs with poor readability (grade level >14 or <6)
   - JDs with outdated content (not updated in >2 years)

4. **Quality Leaders & Laggards**
   - Top 10 highest quality JDs (benchmarks)
   - Bottom 10 lowest quality JDs (improvement needed)
   - Advisor quality performance leaderboard
   - Department quality comparison

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Real-time quality calculations across all dimensions
- ✅ Drill-down from org-level to department to individual JD

### Quality Scoring Algorithm

**Overall Quality Score Calculation**:
```
Overall Score = (
  Completeness × 30% +
  Readability × 20% +
  Consistency × 20% +
  Inclusivity × 20% +
  Concurrence × 10%
) × 100

Completeness = (Populated Required Sections / Total Required Sections)
Readability = Normalized Flesch-Kincaid Score (target range: 8-12)
Consistency = (Matches to Org Style Guide / Total Style Checks)
Inclusivity = (1 - Bias Instances / Total Words)
Concurrence = (Validated Sentence Pairs / Total Sentence Pairs) [bilingual only]
```

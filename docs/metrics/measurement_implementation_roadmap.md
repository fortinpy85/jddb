# Measurement Implementation Roadmap: JDDB Prototype Validation

This roadmap outlines the key activities and timeline for setting up, monitoring, and analyzing the metrics for the JDDB side-by-side editor prototype validation.

---

## Week 1-2: Setup Phase

### **Objective:** Establish all data collection mechanisms and baseline measurements.

- **Task 1.1: Analytics Tool Configuration**
    - **Description:** Set up and configure the chosen analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics, custom logging solution) for the prototype environment.
    - **Responsible:** Frontend Developer, Backend Developer
    - **Deliverable:** Configured analytics platform, accessible dashboards.

- **Task 1.2: Custom Event Tracking Specifications**
    - **Description:** Define and implement custom event tracking for all key user actions related to collaboration and AI suggestions (e.g., `session_joined`, `edit_made`, `ai_suggestion_triggered`, `ai_suggestion_accepted`).
    - **Responsible:** Frontend Developer, Backend Developer
    - **Deliverable:** Implemented event tracking code, verified data flow to analytics platform.

- **Task 1.3: Baseline Measurement Establishment**
    - **Description:** Collect initial data for metrics where a baseline is needed (e.g., typical load times, initial error rates) before active user testing begins.
    - **Responsible:** Backend Developer, Frontend Developer
    - **Deliverable:** Baseline data report.

- **Task 1.4: User Feedback System Deployment**
    - **Description:** Prepare and deploy mechanisms for collecting qualitative user feedback (e.g., short in-app surveys, interview scheduling tool).
    - **Responsible:** Product Manager, UX/UI Designer
    - **Deliverable:** Functional feedback collection tools.

## Week 3-X: Active Monitoring & Iteration Phase

### **Objective:** Continuously monitor prototype performance, gather insights, and drive iterative improvements.

- **Task 2.1: Daily Dashboard Review**
    - **Description:** Review Tier 1 metrics daily to identify any immediate issues or significant deviations from targets.
    - **Responsible:** Product Manager, Technical Lead
    - **Deliverable:** Daily status check, immediate issue flagging.

- **Task 2.2: Weekly Insight Synthesis Sessions**
    - **Description:** Conduct weekly meetings to analyze Tier 1 and Tier 2 metrics, combine quantitative data with qualitative feedback, and identify patterns.
    - **Responsible:** Product Manager, UX/UI Designer, Technical Lead
    - **Deliverable:** Weekly insights report, prioritized list of improvements.

- **Task 2.3: Iterative Improvement Implementation**
    - **Description:** Based on weekly insights, implement prioritized bug fixes, performance optimizations, and minor UI/UX refinements.
    - **Responsible:** Development Team
    - **Deliverable:** Deployed code changes, updated prototype.

- **Task 2.4: Regular User Interviews/Usability Testing**
    - **Description:** Conduct ongoing qualitative research sessions with prototype users to gather deeper insights and validate changes.
    - **Responsible:** UX/UI Designer
    - **Deliverable:** User research findings, updated user personas (if necessary).

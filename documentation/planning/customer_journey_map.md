## Journey 1: New User Onboarding & First Use (Phase 1)

*   **Persona:** Alex, the Power User
*   **Goal:** To get acquainted with the JDDB and successfully upload, search for, and view a job description.

| Stage | User Actions | Touchpoints | Emotional State | Pain Points | Opportunities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Invitation & First Login** | Alex receives an invitation email. Clicks the link, sets a password, and logs in for the first time. | Invitation Email, Login Page, Dashboard | Curious, Hopeful | Uncertainty about what to do first. | A clear welcome message and a "Get Started" guide on the dashboard. |
| **2. Uploading Documents** | Alex navigates to the "Upload" section and drags a batch of 10 JD files into the uploader. | Dashboard, Upload Interface | Focused, Impatient | Wants to know the status of the upload and processing. | Provide real-time progress bars and a clear success message upon completion. |
| **3. Searching for a Document** | After the upload is complete, Alex goes to the search page and uses a keyword and a classification filter to find a specific JD. | Search Interface, Filter Panel | Goal-oriented, Analytical | Search results could be overwhelming if not ranked well. | Ensure search results are relevant and easy to scan. Highlight search terms. |
| **4. Viewing & Analysis** | Alex clicks on a search result and opens the document viewer. They scan the extracted sections and metadata. | Document Viewer | Satisfied, Relieved | Wants to easily copy text or see the original file. | Provide a "copy to clipboard" feature for text sections and a link to the original source file. |
| **5. Post-Use Reflection** | Alex feels confident that the tool will save them significant time compared to the old manual process. | - | Empowered, Efficient | Thinks about other features they would like to see (e.g., comparison, editing). | Proactively ask for feedback via a small, non-intrusive survey or link. |

## Journey 2: Collaborative Document Creation (Future - Phase 2)

*   **Personas:** Alex (HR Power User) & a Hiring Manager
*   **Goal:** To co-author a new job description from a template, finalize it, and get it ready for approval, all within the JDDB platform.

| Stage | User Actions | Touchpoints | Emotional State | Pain Points | Opportunities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Initiation & Invitation** | Alex creates a new JD from a template and invites the Hiring Manager to collaborate via a shared link. | JDDB Editor, Email Notification | Proactive, Collaborative | The manager might be hesitant to use a new tool. | Make the invitation friendly and the entry into the editor seamless (no login required for the guest). |
| **2. Real-Time Co-Editing** | Alex and the manager are in the side-by-side editor at the same time. The manager makes edits to the "Responsibilities" section, and Alex sees the changes live. | Side-by-Side Editor | Engaged, Productive | Potential for conflicting edits or confusion about who is doing what. | Clear cursors/avatars for each user. A smooth, fast sync experience. |
| **3. AI-Powered Suggestions** | Alex highlights a paragraph and clicks the "Improve with AI" button. The AI suggests a more concise and compliant version, which Alex accepts. | AI Assistant Panel | Impressed, Efficient | The AI suggestion might not be perfect. | Allow the user to easily edit the AI's suggestion before accepting it. |
| **4. Commenting & Resolution** | The manager is unsure about a specific requirement and leaves a comment. Alex replies to the comment, clarifying the point, and then resolves the thread. | Commenting System | Communicative, Clear | Comments could get lost or go unnoticed. | Provide clear notifications for new comments and a way to track unresolved threads. |
| **5. Finalization & Approval** | Once all edits are done and comments are resolved, Alex clicks a "Finalize" button, which locks the document and sends a notification that it's ready for the formal approval process. | Approval Workflow UI | Accomplished, Confident | Uncertainty about what happens next in the process. | A clear confirmation message that the document has been submitted for approval and its status is now "Pending Review". |

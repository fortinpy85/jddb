# Job Description Ingestion Engine Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the development of an ingestion engine to process 282 government job description files (5.1MB total) into a structured database optimized for generative AI applications. The system will enable HR teams to leverage AI for job analysis, comparison, and automated insights.

## Data Analysis Results

**File Inventory:**

- **Total Files:** 282 job descriptions
- **Languages:** 243 English (JD), 29 French (DE)
- **Classification Levels:**
  - EX-01: 154 files (Director level)
  - EX-02: 58 files (Executive Director level)
  - EX-03: 45 files (Director General level)
  - EX-04: 14 files (Assistant Deputy Minister level)
  - EX-05: 5 files (Senior ADM/Deputy Minister level)
- **File Size Range:** 706 bytes to 66KB (average: 18KB)

**Content Structure:** Government position descriptions with standardized sections including General Accountability, Organization Structure, Nature & Scope, Specific Accountabilities, and Dimensions.

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Discovery & Extraction

```python
class FileDiscovery:
    - scan_directory() -> List[FileMetadata]
    - extract_metadata_from_filename() -> JobMetadata
    - detect_encoding() -> str
    - validate_file_format() -> bool
```

**Key Components:**

- File system crawler with classification-aware filtering
- Metadata extraction from filenames (job numbers, classifications, language)
- Encoding detection for proper text processing
- File validation and quality checks

### Phase 2: Content Processing Engine

```python
class ContentProcessor:
    - extract_sections() -> Dict[str, str]
    - clean_text() -> str
    - identify_language() -> str
    - parse_structured_fields() -> JobFields
```

**Processing Pipeline:**

1. **Section Identification:** Use regex patterns to identify standard sections
2. **Field Extraction:** Extract position title, job number, classification, reporting structure
3. **Text Cleaning:** Remove formatting artifacts, normalize whitespace
4. **Bilingual Handling:** Process both English and French content appropriately

### Phase 3: Semantic Enhancement

```python
class SemanticProcessor:
    - chunk_content() -> List[Chunk]
    - generate_embeddings() -> np.array
    - extract_relationships() -> List[Relationship]
    - identify_skills() -> List[Skill]
```

**Enhancement Features:**

- **Smart Chunking:** Section-aware chunking for optimal RAG performance
- **Embedding Generation:** Create vector representations for semantic search
- **Relationship Mapping:** Extract reporting relationships and similar roles
- **Skill Extraction:** Identify competencies and requirements

### Phase 4: Database Design

#### Core Tables

```sql
-- Main job descriptions table
CREATE TABLE job_descriptions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    job_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
    title VARCHAR(500),
    classification VARCHAR(10),
    language VARCHAR(2),
    file_path VARCHAR(1000),
    raw_content TEXT,
    processed_date TIMESTAMP,
    file_hash VARCHAR(64)
);

-- Structured sections
CREATE TABLE job_sections (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id INTEGER REFERENCES job_descriptions(id),
    section_type VARCHAR(50),
    section_content TEXT,
    section_order INTEGER
);

-- Semantic chunks for RAG
CREATE TABLE content_chunks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id INTEGER REFERENCES job_descriptions(id),
    section_id INTEGER REFERENCES job_sections(id),
    chunk_text TEXT,
    chunk_index INTEGER,
    embedding VECTOR(1536) -- OpenAI embedding dimension
);

-- Extracted metadata
CREATE TABLE job_metadata (
    job_id INTEGER REFERENCES job_descriptions(id),
    reports_to VARCHAR(500),
    department VARCHAR(200),
    location VARCHAR(200),
    fte_count INTEGER,
    salary_budget DECIMAL,
    effective_date DATE
);
```

#### Vector Storage

- **Primary Option:** PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Alternative:** ChromaDB or Pinecone for dedicated vector operations
- **Indexing:** HNSW indices for fast similarity search

### Processing Patterns

**1. Robust Section Extraction:**

```python
SECTION_PATTERNS = {
    'general_accountability': r'GENERAL ACCOUNTABILITY\s*(.+?)(?=ORGANIZATION|$)',
    'organization_structure': r'ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE\s*(.+?)(?=NATURE|$)',

}
```

**2. Smart Chunking Strategy:**

```python
def chunk_by_section(content: str, max_chunk_size: int = 512) -> List[Chunk]:
    # Preserve section boundaries
    # Maintain context overlap
    # Optimize for embedding models
```

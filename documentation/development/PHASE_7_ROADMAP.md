---

### Phase 7.2: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Priority**: Critical

#### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Recommended Stack**: GitHub Actions (already integrated with repository)

**Pipeline Stages**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml

name: JDDB CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  # Stage 1: Code Quality
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Lint (Prettier, ESLint, Ruff)
      - Type check (TypeScript, MyPy)
      - Security scan (npm audit, pip-audit)
      - Secret detection (detect-secrets)

  # Stage 2: Unit Tests
  test-backend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Setup Python + Poetry
      - Install dependencies
      - Run pytest with coverage
      - Upload coverage to Codecov

  test-frontend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    steps:
      - Build frontend (Bun)
      - Build backend Docker image
      - Push to Azure Container Registry
      - Tag with commit SHA

  # Stage 6: Deploy to Staging
  deploy-staging:
    needs: [build]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - Deploy to Azure App Service (staging slot)
      - Run smoke tests

- ✅ All E2E tests (6/7 minimum)
- ✅ Accessibility tests (WCAG AA)
- ✅ Security scan (no critical vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Build successful (no errors)
- ✅ Smoke tests on staging

---

### Phase 7.3: Monitoring & Observability
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: High

#### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

**Recommended: Azure Application Insights**

**Metrics to Track**:

**Performance Metrics**:
```
- API response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Page load time (First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive)
- Database query performance
- Background job duration
- Memory and CPU usage
```

**Business Metrics**:
```
- Active users (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Job descriptions processed per day
- API calls per endpoint
- Language preference distribution (EN vs FR)
- Feature usage (search, upload, translate, improve)
```

**Error Metrics**:
```
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx)
- Failed API calls
- Frontend exceptions
- Database connection errors
- Translation API failures
```

#### Error Tracking

**Recommended: Sentry**

**Integration**:
```typescript
// Frontend: src/frontend.tsx
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // 100% in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // 10% of sessions
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // 100% of errors
});
```

```python
# Backend: backend/src/jd_ingestion/api/main.py
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn=settings.SENTRY_DSN,
    environment=settings.ENVIRONMENT,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

**Features**:
- Real-time error notifications
- Stack traces with source maps
- User session replay
- Performance monitoring
- Release tracking

#### Logging Strategy

**Log Levels**:
```
ERROR - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
WARN  - Potential issues, degraded performance
INFO  - Important business events (job created, user login)
DEBUG - Detailed diagnostic information (development only)
```

**Structured Logging**:
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

logger.info(
    "job_created",
    job_id=job.id,
    job_number=job.job_number,
    user_id=current_user.id,
    language=job.language,
    processing_time_ms=duration,
)
```

**Log Aggregation**:
- [ ] Azure Log Analytics
- [ ] Elasticsearch + Kibana (alternative)
- [ ] CloudWatch Logs (if on AWS)

#### Alerting Rules

**Critical Alerts** (PagerDuty/Teams):
```
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- API response time p95 > 2 seconds
- Database connection failures
- Disk space < 10%
- Memory usage > 90%
- SSL certificate expiring in 7 days
```

**Warning Alerts** (Slack/Teams):
```
- Error rate > 1% for 15 minutes
- API response time p95 > 1 second
- Slow database queries (> 1 second)
- High API rate from single user (potential abuse)
- Translation API errors
```

#### Health Check Endpoints

```python
# Backend: /api/health
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
        "checks": {
            "database": await check_database(),
            "redis": await check_redis(),
            "disk_space": check_disk_space(),
        }
    }

@app.get("/health/ready")
async def readiness_check():
    # Deep health check for load balancer
    db_ok = await database.is_connected()
    return {"ready": db_ok}
```

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced Bias Detection (100% Complete)

**Implementation**: `backend/src/jd_ingestion/services/ai_enhancement_service.py`

#### Pattern-Based Detection

**Gender Bias** (lines 471-655):
- ✅ Gender-specific pronouns (he, she, his, her, him, himself, herself)
- ✅ Gendered job titles (chairman, salesman, policeman, fireman, etc.)
- ✅ Masculine-coded language (aggressive, dominant, competitive, etc.)
- ✅ Feminine-coded language (supportive, nurturing, collaborative, etc.)
- ✅ Imbalance detection (flags when ratio exceeds 70% in one direction)

**Age Bias** (lines 657-784):
- ✅ Age-discriminatory terms (young, youthful, energetic, digital native)
- ✅ Explicit age requirements detection (e.g., "25-35 years old")
- ✅ Experience-based discrimination (20+ years requirements)
- ✅ Generational references (millennials, recent graduates)

**Disability Bias** (lines 786-963):
- ✅ Physical ability requirements (must be able to stand/walk/lift)
- ✅ Sensory ability requirements (perfect vision, good hearing)
- ✅ Mental/cognitive assumptions (quick learner, mentally fit)
- ✅ Ableist language (normal, suffers from, wheelchair-bound)
- ✅ Transportation requirements (driver's license, own car)

**Cultural & Socioeconomic Bias** (lines 965-1131):
- ✅ Geographic/cultural requirements (North American experience, native speaker)
- ✅ Socioeconomic barriers (own laptop, home office, professional wardrobe)
- ✅ Educational elitism (top-tier university, Ivy League)
- ✅ Networking privilege (well-connected, established connections)
- ✅ Cultural fit language detection

#### AI-Enhanced Detection (lines 211-314)

- ✅ **GPT-4 Context-Aware Analysis**: Detects subtle bias that pattern matching misses
- ✅ Configurable via `use_gpt4` parameter (default: true)
- ✅ Identifies context-dependent bias
- ✅ Provides contextual explanations
- ✅ Lower temperature (0.3) for consistent analysis
- ✅ Graceful fallback to pattern-only analysis if GPT-4 unavailable

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/analyze-bias?use_gpt4={true|false}`

**Test Results**:
```json
Sample Text: "We are seeking a young, energetic salesman with perfect vision.
He must be able to stand for long periods and be a native English speaker.
Recent graduates preferred."

Issues Detected: 8
- Gender bias: 2 issues ("He", "salesman")
- Age bias: 2 issues ("young", "energetic")
- Disability bias: 3 issues ("must be able to stand", "perfect vision")
- Cultural bias: 1 issue ("native English speaker")

Inclusivity Score: 0.0/1.0 (as expected for problematic text)
```

### 2. Quality Scoring System (100% Complete)

**Implementation**: `backend/src/jd_ingestion/services/ai_enhancement_service.py`

#### Readability Scoring (lines 1169-1278)

Uses `textstat` library for comprehensive metrics:
- ✅ **Flesch Reading Ease**: Measures text difficulty (0-100 scale)
- ✅ **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Required education level (target: 8-10)
- ✅ **SMOG Index**: Years of education needed
- ✅ **Automated Readability Index**: Readability via character counts
- ✅ **Coleman-Liau Index**: Based on characters per word/sentence
- ✅ **Target Compliance**: Validates against Grade 8-10 accessibility standard
- ✅ **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific guidance for improvement

#### Completeness Scoring (lines 1280-1421)

Evaluates section presence and content adequacy:
- ✅ **Required Sections**: General Accountability, Organization Structure, Key Responsibilities, Qualifications
- ✅ **Weighted Scoring**: Different sections have different importance (25-30%)
- ✅ **Minimum Word Counts**: 50-100 words depending on section
- ✅ **Partial Credit**: Sections get proportional scores if present but thin
- ✅ **Detailed Analysis**: Per-section breakdown with word counts
- ✅ **Recommendations**: Specific guidance on which sections need expansion

#### Clarity & Structure Scoring (lines 1423-1496)

Analyzes writing quality:
- ✅ **Average Sentence Length**: Optimal range 15-25 words
- ✅ **Long Sentence Detection**: Flags sentences over 30 words
- ✅ **Paragraph Analysis**: Checks for proper text organization
- ✅ **Clarity Score**: Based on sentence complexity and structure
- ✅ **Improvement Guidance**: Specific recommendations for enhancement

#### Comprehensive Quality Score (lines 1498-1653)

**Overall Scoring Formula**:
```
Overall Quality = (
    Readability * 0.20 +
    Completeness * 0.25 +
    Clarity * 0.15 +
    Inclusivity * 0.20 +
    Compliance * 0.20
) * 100

Result: 0-100 scale
- 90-100: Excellent (green)
- 75-89: Good (blue)
- 60-74: Fair (yellow)
- Below 60: Needs Improvement (red)
```

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/quality-score`

**Test Results**:
```json
Sample Job Description:
{
  "general_accountability": "The Director will oversee strategic planning...",
  "organization_structure": "Reports to ADM. Manages team of 12...",
  "key_responsibilities": "Lead strategic planning initiatives...",
  "qualifications": "Master's degree in public administration..."
}

Overall Score: 73.2/100 (Fair - Yellow)

Dimension Breakdown:
- Readability: 57.1% (Grade 13.29 - too difficult)
- Completeness: 61.0% (sections need expansion)
- Clarity: 70.0% (good, needs paragraph breaks)
- Inclusivity: 100.0% (no bias detected)
- Compliance: 80.0% (placeholder)

Top Recommendations:
1. Simplify sentences for accessibility
2. Reduce reading level from Grade 13 to 8-10
3. Expand sections to meet minimum word counts

Improvement Priority: Readability, Completeness
```

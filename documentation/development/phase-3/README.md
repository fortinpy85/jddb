#### Web Experience Toolkit (WET) Integration ‚≠ê NEW

*   **Government of Canada Design System Compliance**:
    - Integrate WET (Web Experience Toolkit) for WCAG 2.0 Level AA accessibility compliance
    - Implement bilingual (EN/FR) support with 32+ additional languages
    - Apply Government of Canada branding and web standards
    - Use battle-tested accessible UI components from federal framework
    - Three implementation options: Full Integration (4-6 weeks), Hybrid Approach (2-3 weeks), or WET-Inspired (1-2 weeks)
    - Decision tree based on: GC project status, legal accessibility requirements, bilingual needs
    - React packages: `@arcnovus/wet-boew-react` (TypeScript, no jQuery) or `wet-react` (early stage)
    - Resources: https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/ and https://github.com/wet-boew
    - **Priority**: HIGH (if government project), MEDIUM (if accessibility critical), LOW (otherwise)

#### UI Enhancement Tasks (from Phase 2.1 Layout Review)

*   **Right Sidebar Context Panel**:
    - Implement contextual properties panel for job details, metadata, and quick actions
    - Display related jobs, version history, and collaboration status
    - Adaptive content based on current view (jobs, editing, comparison)
    - Framework already exists in TwoPanelLayout, needs content implementation

*   **Alternative View Modes**:
    - Card Grid View: Visual card-based layout as alternative to data table for jobs list
    - Density Controls: Toggle between compact and detailed card displays
    - View Preferences: Save user preferences for default view mode per section
    - Smooth transitions between view modes

*   **User Profile Dashboard**:
    - Profile Summary Section: Display username, role, recent activity, quick stats
    - Position between header and alert banner for consistent visibility
    - Personal workspace metrics and activity feed
    - Quick access to user-specific filters and saved searches

*   **Advanced Data Loading Patterns**:
    - Infinite Scroll: IntersectionObserver-based lazy loading for large datasets
    - "Load More" button pattern for mobile views
    - Progressive loading with skeleton states
    - Pagination + infinite scroll hybrid approach

*   **Enhanced Card Components**:
    - Compact Card Mode: Higher density "Small format" cards for sidebar sections
    - Responsive card sizing based on viewport and content density preferences
    - Enhanced visual hierarchy with improved typography and spacing
    - Accessibility improvements for keyboard navigation within cards

## Tasks from Previous Phases

### Critical Backend Gaps (URGENT)

*   **Job Detail API Endpoint** ‚ùå BLOCKING:
    - Implement GET `/api/jobs/{id}` endpoint to retrieve full job details
    - Frontend JobDetailView already implemented but API is missing
    - Users cannot view individual job details (clicking job rows fails)
    - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Complete before other Phase 3 work
    - **Effort**: 1-2 days backend implementation

### Code Review and Optimization

*   **File Organization & Streamlining**: Consolidate duplicate modules, clean up endpoints, and refactor services.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries, implement caching, and reduce bundle size.

### Documentation Enhancement

*   **API Documentation**: Enhance OpenAPI schema with examples and document error codes.
*   **Code Documentation**: Add module docstrings, complete type annotations, and create architecture diagrams.
*   **Developer Documentation**: Enhance setup guides, document testing strategies, and create deployment guides.

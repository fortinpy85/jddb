# Phase 6 Plan: Intelligent Content & WET Integration

**Goal:** Evolve the application into an intelligent content assistant by building AI-powered generation features and ensuring government compliance through Web Experience Toolkit (WET) integration.

**Status:** This plan combines the forward-looking features from the original `phase-4/README.md` and `TODO.md` with the critical WET integration plan.

### 1. Intelligent Content Generation

*   **Feature:** AI-Assisted Job Description Writing.
    *   **Details:** Develop a feature where a user can input a job title and key skills to generate a full job description draft, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) and the skill data integrated in Phase 5.
    *   **Source:** `phase-4/TODO.md`

*   **Feature:** "Source-to-Post" Job Posting Generation.
    *   **Details:** Create a tool that transforms a detailed internal job description into a concise, public-facing job posting, with optimizations for platforms like GC Jobs and LinkedIn.
    *   **Source:** `phase-4/TODO.md`

*   **Feature:** Predictive Content Analytics.
    *   **Details:** Implement analytics to predict application volume and time-to-fill based on a job description's content and required skills.
    *   **Source:** `phase-4/TODO.md`

### 2. Web Experience Toolkit (WET) Integration

*   **Action:** Evaluate and select a WET integration strategy.
    *   **Details:** Based on the decision framework in `wet-integration-plan.md`, choose between Full Integration (Option A), a Hybrid Approach (Option B), or WET-Inspired Patterns (Option C). This decision is critical for government-facing projects.
    *   **Source:** `wet-integration-plan.md`, `ui-enhancements.md`

*   **Action:** Execute the chosen WET integration plan.
    *   **Details:** Follow the phased technical approach for the selected option, focusing on migrating forms, alerts, and navigation to be WCAG 2.0 AA compliant and fully bilingual.
    *   **Source:** `wet-integration-plan.md`

### 3. Advanced UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Action:** Implement the "Smart Inline Diff Viewer" and "Live Reactive Panel".
    *   **Details:** While sprint reports claim this is complete, this phase will formally verify the integration and polish the features for production use. This includes the dual-panel comparison UI and the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) data pipeline.
    *   **Source:** `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md`, `improvements.md`

*   **Action:** Implement remaining high-priority UI enhancements.
    *   **Details:** Add a card-based grid view for jobs, context-aware side panels, and infinite scroll/lazy loading for long lists.
    *   **Source:** `ui-enhancements.md`

**Milestone / Definition of Done:**
*   The application includes at least one functional AI content generation feature.
*   A WET integration strategy has been implemented, and the application meets the targeted level of accessibility and bilingualism.
*   The "Smart Inline Diff Viewer" is fully integrated and verified.

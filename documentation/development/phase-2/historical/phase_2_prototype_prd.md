# Product Requirements Document: Phase 2 - Editor Prototype

**Product Name:** JDDB - Phase 2 Prototype
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 16, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the **Phase 2 Prototype** of the Job Description Database (JDDB). This prototype is a 21-day project focused on developing and validating a side-by-side, collaborative editor with a single AI-powered feature. It builds upon the completed Phase 1 ingestion engine.

## 2. Vision and Strategy

### 2.1. Product Concept

The prototype will demonstrate the core functionality of a real-time, collaborative job description editor. The goal is to validate the technical approach and user value of a side-by-side editing experience before committing to building the full-featured translation and collaboration platform outlined in the Phase 2 vision.

### 2.2. Business Context

To support the Government Modernization Initiative, we need to move beyond simple data ingestion and provide tools that actively assist in the creation and refinement of high-quality job descriptions. This prototype is the first step towards that goal.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for this prototype is **Executive Managers** and **HR Classification Specialists** who are involved in the drafting and review of job descriptions.

## 4. User Stories & Requirements

### 4.1. User Stories

*   **As an Executive Manager, I want to** see the original job description and my proposed changes side-by-side, so I can easily track my edits.
*   **As an HR Specialist, I want to** collaborate with a manager in real-time to draft a job description, so we can finalize it in a single session.
*   **As a user, I want to** get instant feedback on the grammar and clarity of my writing, so I can produce a high-quality document.

### 4.2. Functional Requirements

The prototype will have the following functional requirements:

#### 4.2.1. Side-by-Side Editor Interface

*   The UI will display two text editor panels side-by-side.
*   One panel will be for the source document (read-only), and the other for the target document (editable).

#### 4.2.2. Real-Time Synchronization

*   The system will use WebSockets to provide real-time synchronization of content between clients viewing the same document.
*   Changes made by one user in the target panel will be visible to other users in real-time.

#### 4.2.3. AI-Powered Suggestion

*   The system will provide a single AI-powered suggestion feature: a grammar and style check.
*   A user can trigger this check on a selection of text.
*   The system will display the AI's suggestion to the user.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Performance

*   Real-time updates between clients should have a latency of less than 200ms.

### 5.2. Scalability

*   The prototype should be able to support at least 10 concurrent users on a single document.

## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

*   This is a 21-day project.
*   The prototype will be built on the existing JDDB infrastructure (FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL).
*   The focus is on validating the core concept, not on production-ready features.

## 7. Success Metrics

The success of the prototype will be measured by:

*   **Functionality:** A working side-by-side editor with real-time sync and one AI feature.
*   **User Feedback:** Positive feedback from at least 3 internal users on the concept and usability.
*   **Technical Validation:** Confirmation that our chosen tech stack can support the real-time collaboration features required for the full Phase 2 vision.

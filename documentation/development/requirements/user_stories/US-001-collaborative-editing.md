# US-001: Real-Time Collaborative Editing

## 1. User Persona Analysis and Context

### 1.1 Detailed User Persona Profile

- **Persona:** Alex, the HR Power User, collaborating with a Hiring Manager.
- **Demographics and Background:**
    - **Alex:** Senior HR Business Partner, 10+ years of experience. Tech-savvy and comfortable with complex software.
    - **Hiring Manager:** Executive level, 15+ years of experience. Not necessarily tech-savvy, time-poor, and focused on outcomes, not tools.
- **Goals and Motivations:**
    - **Alex:** Wants to finalize a high-quality JD quickly, reduce email back-and-forth, and ensure compliance.
    - **Hiring Manager:** Wants to ensure the JD accurately reflects the role's responsibilities with minimal time spent in a tool they don't know.
- **Behavioral Characteristics:**
    - **Alex:** Will drive the tool, initiate the session, and guide the manager.
    - **Hiring Manager:** Will be a guest in the session, focused only on the content, and will likely want to exit the tool as soon as the task is done.

### 1.2 User Journey Context

- **Pre-Feature Context:** Alex has identified a JD that needs updating. Previously, they would download the Word document, make changes, email it to the manager, wait for the manager to email back a revised version (often without track changes), and then manually merge the changes. This process is slow and prone to version control errors.
- **Post-Feature Context:** After the collaborative session, Alex will have a finalized draft that is ready for the formal approval process. They will feel confident that the manager has directly signed off on the content.

## 2. Core User Story

- **User Story:** "As a **Senior HR Business Partner (Alex)**, I want to **edit a job description in real-time with a Hiring Manager** so that we can **finalize the content in a single, efficient session and eliminate version control issues**."

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** Alex and a Hiring Manager are both viewing the same document in the side-by-side editor.
    - **When** the Hiring Manager types a change in their designated editor panel.
    - **Then** Alex should see the change appear on their screen within 200ms.
    - **And** the changes should be saved to the database automatically.

- **Business Value:** This story is the core of the Phase 2 vision. It directly addresses the primary pain point of inefficient, email-based collaboration. Success here will dramatically reduce the time it takes to finalize JDs, improve the quality of the content, and provide a vastly superior user experience, which is a key differentiator from competitors.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- **Core Functionality:**
    - The system must provide a WebSocket endpoint that manages connections to a specific document editor session.
    - When one client sends an `editor.update` message, the server must broadcast that update to all other clients in the same session.
    - The system must persist the final state of the document to the PostgreSQL database.
- **User Interface Requirements:**
    - The UI must display two text editor panels side-by-side.
    - The UI must show avatars or names of all users currently active in the session.
    - The cursor position of other users should be visible in the editor.
- **Data Requirements:**
    - A new database table (`editing_sessions` or similar) is needed to manage collaborative sessions.
    - The content of the document should be stored as text or a suitable format like JSON (e.g., for a block-based editor).

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance Criteria:**
    - **Latency:** Real-time updates between clients must have a perceived latency of less than 200ms.
    - **Scalability:** The prototype must support at least 10 concurrent users in a single document session without noticeable degradation in performance.
- **Usability Standards:**
    - The editor should be intuitive, with standard text formatting controls (bold, italics, lists).
    - It should be immediately obvious to a first-time user (like the Hiring Manager) which panel they are supposed to edit.
- **Quality Assurance:**
    - Testing must be done across multiple browser tabs and different user accounts to simulate a real collaborative session.
    - The WebSocket connection and message broadcasting must be thoroughly tested.

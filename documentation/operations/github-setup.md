- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development guidelines.
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history.
- **LICENSE**: Legal framework (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).

### 1.2. Configuration Files
- **.gitignore**: Optimized for Python/Node.js projects.

- **Access Control**: Configure branch protection rules and required status checks.

### 1.4. Code Quality & Testing
- **Test Suite**: Ensure all tests pass in the CI environment.
- **Code Standards**: Run linters and formatters (`black`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `Prettier`).
- **Documentation**: Ensure all functions have proper docstrings and comments.

### 1.5. CI/CD Pipeline

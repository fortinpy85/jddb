## Problem Statement

The JDDB project required a comprehensive testing strategy that could support:
- End-to-end testing of complex user workflows
- Unit testing of React components and utility functions
- Integration testing of API endpoints and database operations
- Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance testing for collaborative features
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Playwright (E2E) + Bun Test Runner (Unit/Integration) - Chosen

- **Description:** Hybrid approach using specialized tools for different test types
- **Pros:**
    - Playwright excellence for browser automation and E2E testing
    - Bun's native speed advantage for unit test execution
    - Built-in TypeScript support without configuration
    - Accessibility testing capabilities in Playwright
    - Cross-browser testing support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
    - Mobile device emulation for responsive testing
    - Fast feedback loop with Bun's test runner
    - Unified JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
- **Cons:**
    - Two testing tools to maintain and configure
    - Different syntax patterns between test runners
    - Potential complexity in CI/CD setup

### Option 2: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright

- **Description:** Traditional React testing stack with Playwright for E2E
- **Pros:**
    - Industry standard with extensive ecosystem
    - Mature snapshot testing capabilities
    - Excellent React component testing patterns
    - Large community and extensive documentation
- **Cons:**
    - Slower test execution compared to Bun
    - Complex configuration for TypeScript and ES modules
    - Additional dependencies and setup overhead
    - Potential conflicts with Bun runtime environment

### Option 3: Cypress + Vitest

- **Description:** Modern testing stack with Cypress for E2E and Vitest for units
- **Pros:**
    - Excellent developer experience with Cypress
    - Fast unit testing with Vitest
    - Good debugging capabilities
- **Cons:**
    - Cypress limitations for cross-browser testing
    - Additional complexity with multiple testing frameworks
    - Learning curve for team members familiar with Playwright

### Option 4: Playwright Only (All Test Types)

- **Description:** Single tool approach using Playwright for all testing
- **Pros:**
    - Single tool to learn and maintain
    - Consistent testing patterns across all types
    - Excellent browser automation capabilities
- **Cons:**
    - Overkill for simple unit tests
    - Slower execution for unit tests compared to native runners
    - Less optimal developer experience for component testing

## Decision & Rationale

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Playwright (E2E) + Bun Test Runner (Unit/Integration)

**Rationale:**
The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of each tool. Playwright excels at browser automation, accessibility testing, and complex user workflows critical for JDDB's collaborative features. Bun's test runner provides superior performance for unit tests, aligning with the project's focus on development velocity. The combination ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining fast feedback loops for developers.

## Impact Assessment

- **Positive Impacts:**
    - Fast unit test execution improving developer productivity
    - Comprehensive E2E testing ensuring user workflow reliability
    - Built-in accessibility testing supporting government compliance
    - Cross-browser testing catching compatibility issues early
    - Mobile testing ensuring responsive design functionality
    - TypeScript support reducing configuration overhead
    - Performance testing capabilities for collaborative features

- **Negative Impacts / Trade-offs:**
    - Team needs familiarity with both Playwright and Bun testing patterns
    - CI/CD configuration requires setup for both tools
    - Potential duplication in integration testing approaches
    - Different debugging approaches for each tool

- **Impact on other areas:**
    - Development workflow includes both unit and E2E test runs
    - CI/CD pipeline requires parallel execution for performance
    - Documentation needs to cover both testing approaches
    - Code coverage reports need aggregation across tools

## Follow-up Information

- **Implementation Status:** Completed
- **Review Date:** 2026-03-18 (6-month review of testing effectiveness and performance)
- **Related Decisions:**
    - ADR-003: Bun as JavaScript Runtime and Package Manager
    - ADR-004: Frontend Architecture Approach
- **Test Structure:**
    - Unit tests: `src/**/*.test.ts` using Bun test runner
    - E2E tests: `tests/*.spec.ts` using Playwright
    - Coverage target: 90% for critical paths
- **Accessibility Standards:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing included in E2E suite

## Problem Statement

The JDDB frontend required selection of a JavaScript runtime and package manager that could provide:
- Fast development builds and hot-reloading
- Efficient package installation and dependency management
- Native bundling capabilities for production builds
- TypeScript support without complex configuration
- Modern JavaScript features and performance optimization

---

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Bun (All-in-One Solution) - Chosen

- **Description:** Modern JavaScript runtime, package manager, and bundler built with Zig
- **Pros:**
    - Significantly faster package installation compared to npm/yarn (3-10x speedup)
    - Built-in bundler eliminates need for webpack/vite configuration
    - Native TypeScript support without transpilation overhead
    - Single runtime for development and production
    - Hot-reloading with minimal configuration
    - Smaller bundle sizes through tree-shaking optimization
- **Cons:**
    - Newer technology with smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js
    - Potential compatibility issues with some npm packages
    - Less mature debugging tooling
    - Smaller community and documentation

### Option 2: Node.js + npm + webpack/vite

- **Description:** Traditional Node.js ecosystem with separate tools
- **Pros:**
    - Mature and well-established ecosystem
    - Extensive community support and documentation
    - Broad package compatibility
    - Proven in enterprise environments
- **Cons:**
    - Slower package installation and builds
    - Complex configuration for bundling (webpack) or additional tools (vite)
    - Multiple tools to maintain and configure
    - Larger development overhead

### Option 3: Node.js + pnpm + vite

- **Description:** Node.js with efficient package manager and modern bundler
- **Pros:**
    - Faster than npm while maintaining compatibility
    - Modern bundling with vite
    - Good performance balance
- **Cons:**
    - Still requires multiple tool configuration
    - Not as fast as Bun for package operations
    - Additional complexity in CI/CD setup

---

## Decision & Rationale

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Bun as All-in-One Solution

**Rationale:**
Development velocity and developer experience are critical for the JDDB project timeline. Bun's dramatic improvement in build times and package installation speed directly impacts daily development productivity. The risk of ecosystem compatibility is mitigated by the project's focus on modern, well-maintained packages. The unified approach reduces configuration overhead and simplifies the development environment setup.

## Impact Assessment

- **Positive Impacts:**
    - 60-80% reduction in `npm install` time improving developer onboarding
    - Faster development builds reducing iteration time
    - Simplified configuration reducing setup complexity
    - Better development experience with hot-reloading performance
    - Smaller production bundles improving load times
    - Native TypeScript support reducing build pipeline complexity

- **Negative Impacts / Trade-offs:**
    - Potential compatibility issues with edge-case npm packages
    - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Bun
    - Less extensive debugging tooling compared to Node.js
    - Dependency on relatively new technology

- **Impact on other areas:**
    - Faster CI/CD builds due to improved package installation speed
    - Simplified deployment configuration with single runtime
    - Documentation needs to include Bun-specific commands
    - Team onboarding includes Bun installation and usage

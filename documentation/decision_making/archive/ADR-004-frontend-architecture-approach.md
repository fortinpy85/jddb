# ADR-004: Frontend Architecture Approach - Custom Bun Server vs Next.js

- **Date:** 2025-09-16
- **Category:** Technical
- **Decision Maker(s):** Technical Lead, Frontend Lead
- **Stakeholders:** Frontend Development Team, DevOps Team

## Problem Statement

The JDDB frontend required an architectural approach that could support:
- Server-side API proxy for backend communication
- Single-page application (SPA) with React components
- Custom routing and navigation patterns
- Efficient development and production builds
- Integration with collaborative editing features and WebSocket communication

---

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Custom Bun Server with React SPA - Chosen

- **Description:** Custom server implementation using Bun runtime serving a React SPA
- **Pros:**
    - Full control over server behavior and routing
    - Simplified proxy configuration for backend API
    - Direct integration with Bun's bundling capabilities
    - Minimal framework overhead and dependencies
    - Custom WebSocket handling without framework constraints
    - Easier integration with collaborative editing features
    - Faster development builds with Bun's native performance
- **Cons:**
    - More custom code to maintain vs framework conventions
    - Manual implementation of common patterns
    - Less built-in optimization compared to mature frameworks
    - Requires deeper understanding of web server fundamentals

### Option 2: Next.js Framework

- **Description:** Industry-standard React framework with built-in server and routing
- **Pros:**
    - Mature framework with extensive ecosystem
    - Built-in server-side rendering and optimization
    - Established patterns and conventions
    - Large community and documentation
    - Built-in routing and API handling
    - Proven enterprise deployment patterns
- **Cons:**
    - Framework overhead for features not needed (SSR, etc.)
    - Less flexibility for custom server requirements
    - Potential conflicts with Bun runtime optimizations
    - More complex configuration for non-standard use cases
    - Additional abstraction layer for WebSocket integration

### Option 3: React SPA with Separate Express Server

- **Description:** Traditional separation with Express.js API proxy server
- **Pros:**
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Mature Express.js ecosystem
    - Flexible server configuration
- **Cons:**
    - Requires Node.js alongside Bun, negating runtime benefits
    - Additional complexity in development setup
    - Multiple processes to manage in production

---

## Decision & Rationale

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Custom Bun Server with React SPA

**Rationale:**
The JDDB project has specific requirements for real-time collaboration and custom API proxy behavior that benefit from direct server control. The custom approach leverages Bun's performance advantages while avoiding framework overhead for unused features. The development velocity gains from Bun's build performance outweigh the additional implementation effort. The architecture provides maximum flexibility for future collaborative editing features.

## Impact Assessment

- **Positive Impacts:**
    - Direct control over server behavior enabling custom collaborative features
    - Optimal performance leveraging Bun's native capabilities
    - Simplified deployment with single runtime
    - Reduced bundle size without framework overhead
    - Faster development iterations with custom build pipeline
    - Clear understanding of all application layers

- **Negative Impacts / Trade-offs:**
    - More custom code to maintain and document
    - Team needs to understand custom architecture patterns
    - Manual implementation of routing and server patterns
    - Potentially longer initial setup time

- **Impact on other areas:**
    - Development team needs documentation for custom patterns
    - Simplified CI/CD with single runtime deployment
    - WebSocket integration can be optimized for specific use cases
    - Testing strategy needs to account for custom server implementation

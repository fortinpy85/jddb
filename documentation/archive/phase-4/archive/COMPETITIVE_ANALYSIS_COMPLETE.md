## 🏆 Competitive Advantages Achieved

### vs. JDXpert
- **✅ We Win**: Inline diff with category highlighting (they only show before/after)
- **✅ We Win**: Granular change control (they use all-or-nothing approach)
- **✅ We Win**: RLHF data capture (they have no feedback loop)

### vs. JDMS (SAP SuccessFactors)
- **✅ We Win**: Live reactive improvements (they use batch processing)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies** (Already done)
   ```bash
   # Frontend packages already installed
   bun install
   ```

2. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry run alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd backend && make server

   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   bun dev
   ```

4. **Integrate ImprovementView** (Manual step required)

   Edit `src/app/page.tsx`:

   ```typescript
   // Step 1: Add import (line ~23)
   import { ImprovementView } from "@/components/improvement/ImprovementView";

   // Step 2: Add to ViewType (line ~49)
   type ViewType =
     | "home"
     | "improvement"  // ADD THIS
     | "upload"
     // ... rest

   // Step 3: Add case to renderContent() (after line ~221)
   case "improvement":
     return (
       <ImprovementView
         jobId={selectedJob?.id}
         initialOriginalText={selectedJob?.sections?.find(s => s.section_type === 'general_accountability')?.section_content || ""}
         onBack={() => handleViewChange(selectedJob ? "job-details" : "home")}
         onSave={(finalText) => {
           console.log("Saved:", finalText);
           handleViewChange(selectedJob ? "job-details" : "home");
         }}
       />
     );

   // Step 4: Update JobDetailView onEdit (line ~184)
   onEdit={() => handleViewChange("improvement")}
   ```

### User Workflow

1. **Access Feature**
   - Jobs → Select Job → Click "Edit"
   - ImprovementView loads with inline diff

2. **Review Changes**
   - See highlighted changes inline
   - Click changes for details
   - Use keyboard shortcuts (⌘+Enter, ⌘+Delete)

3. **Accept/Reject**
   - Accept grammar fixes
   - Reject style changes you disagree with
   - Navigate with arrow keys

4. **Save**
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Final text applied to job
   - RLHF data sent to backend

### Live Reactive Mode (Optional)

Use `useLiveImprovement` hook instead of `useImprovement`:

```typescript
import { useLiveImprovement } from '@/hooks/useLiveImprovement';

const liveImprovement = useLiveImprovement({
  debounceMs: 2000,
  autoAnalyze: true,
  captureRLHF: true,
});

// As user types:
liveImprovement.setOriginalText(userInput);

// Improved text automatically generated:
console.log(liveImprovement.improvedText);
```

---

## 📈 Analytics & Monitoring

### RLHF Dashboard (Available via API)

```typescript
import { rlhfService } from '@/services/rlhfService';

// Get acceptance rate
const stats = await rlhfService.getAcceptanceRate('grammar', 30);
console.log(`Acceptance rate: ${stats.acceptance_rate}%`);

// Get statistics by type
const typeStats = await rlhfService.getTypeStatistics(30);

// Export training data
const trainingData = await rlhfService.exportTrainingData(0.8, 1000);
```

### Metrics to Track

1. **Acceptance Rates** (by type: grammar, style, clarity, bias, compliance)
2. **Time to Complete** (improvement workflow duration)
3. **User Satisfaction** (survey after save)
4. **Feature Adoption** (% sessions using improvement view)
5. **AI Improvement** (acceptance rate trends over time)

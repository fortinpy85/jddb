## âœ… Completed Work

### Phase 3.5 Stabilization (2025-10-04)

The following critical items were successfully completed before Phase 4:

*   âœ… **Frontend Unit Tests** - 100% pass rate (75/75 tests passing) - exceeded 95% target
    *   Fixed syntax errors and test infrastructure issues
    *   Implemented proper DOM cleanup between tests
    *   Added missing test matchers (toHaveClass)

*   âœ… **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Enabled and enforced
    *   Confirmed `"strict": true` in tsconfig.json
    *   Excluded archive directory from type checking
    *   All active code compiles with strict mode

*   âœ… **Null/Undefined Safety Audit** - Critical crashes fixed
    *   Fixed JobDetailView.tsx (unsafe non-null assertions â†’ guard checks)
    *   Fixed enhanced-navigation.tsx (non-null assertion â†’ optional chaining)
    *   No other critical issues found

*   âœ… **React Error Boundaries** - Implemented app-wide
    *   ErrorBoundaryWrapper wraps entire app (page.tsx:332-405)
    *   Shows error details in development mode
    *   Protects all major views from crash propagation

*   âœ… **API Mocking Standardization** - Working correctly
    *   All tests passing with proper mocking
    *   test-setup.ts implements standard patterns

### Integration Sprint (2025-10-04)

*   âœ… **RLHF Pipeline** - Full end-to-end implementation complete
    *   Live Reactive Panel with AI suggestions
    *   Automatic RLHF data capture and sync
    *   Backend infrastructure (RLHFFeedback model, router, migration, 6 endpoints)
    *   Frontend sync with threshold-based triggering (10 events)
    *   Complete validation and testing
    *   **See:** `archive/INTEGRATION_SPRINT_SUMMARY.md` for full details

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 4 Tasks (Remaining Work)

### 1. Code Quality & Technical Debt (Deferred from Phase 3.5)

*   **Action:** Resolve all linter errors and unused variable warnings
    *   **Details:** Address TypeScript/ESLint errors such as `no-explicit-any` and `no-unused-vars`
    *   **Priority:** Low - Not blocking (TypeScript strict mode is enforced and tests pass)
    *   **Approach:** Address incrementally during feature development
    *   **Source:** `critical.md` (Category 2, deferred)

*   **Action:** Remove all debug `console.log` statements from the frontend codebase
    *   **Details:** Clean up debug logging across all components
    *   **Priority:** Low - Code cleanup task
    *   **Source:** `Completion.md`

### 2. Feature Completion & Placeholder Resolution

*   **Action:** Implement "Create New Job" workflow
    *   **Details:** Complete the placeholder logic for creating new job descriptions
    *   **Priority:** Medium - User-facing feature
    *   **Source:** `Completion.md`, `critical.md` (Category 2, deferred)

*   **Action:** Build "System Health" monitoring page
    *   **Details:** Implement the system health dashboard (currently shows placeholder)
    *   **Priority:** Medium - Operational visibility
    *   **Source:** `Completion.md`, `critical.md` (Category 2, deferred)

*   **Action:** Build "User Preferences" page
    *   **Details:** Implement user settings and preferences (currently shows placeholder)
    *   **Priority:** Medium - User experience enhancement
    *   **Source:** `Completion.md`

*   **Action:** Complete "Translate" workflow functionality
    *   **Details:** Implement translation feature (currently has TODO placeholder)
    *   **Priority:** Medium - User-facing feature
    *   **Source:** `Completion.md`, `critical.md` (Category 2, deferred)

*   **Action:** Complete "Reprocess" functionality
    *   **Details:** Implement job reprocessing workflow
    *   **Priority:** Low - Administrative feature
    *   **Source:** `Completion.md`

### 3. Backend Technical Debt

*   **Action:** Refactor or remove outdated/broken backend files
    *   **Details:** Merge and delete `saved_searches_broken.py`. Complete the `AuthService` implementation.
    *   **Priority:** Low - Cleanup task
    *   **Source:** `Completion.md`

### 4. Infrastructure & Developer Experience (Deferred from Phase 3.5)

*   **Action:** Establish baseline for End-to-End (E2E) test coverage
    *   **Details:** Create critical-path Playwright tests:
      1. User login and dashboard view
      2. Full search-to-job-detail flow
      3. File upload and verification flow
    *   **Priority:** High - Important for production readiness
    *   **Status:** Recommended for Phase 4 but not blocking (unit tests provide sufficient coverage)
    *   **Source:** `critical.md` (Category 3, deferred)

*   **Action:** Integrate automated accessibility (a11y) checks
    *   **Details:** Add `axe-core` to Playwright suite to run automated WCAG checks on key pages
    *   **Priority:** High - Required for government-facing tool
    *   **Status:** Important for production but not blocking Phase 4 development
    *   **Source:** `critical.md` (Category 3, deferred)

*   **Action:** Create unified development environment using Docker
    *   **Details:** Build `docker-compose.yml` to manage all services (backend, frontend, DB, Redis)
    *   **Priority:** Medium - Improves developer onboarding
    *   **Status:** Nice-to-have (current setup is functional)
    *   **Source:** `critical.md` (Category 3, deferred), `review.md`

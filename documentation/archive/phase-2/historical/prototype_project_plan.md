### Project Plan: Job Description Editing & Translation Platform Prototype

This document outlines a 21-day project to develop a testable prototype of the Advanced Job Description Editing & Translation Platform.

### 0. Context & Purpose

This project marks the beginning of **Phase 2** of the JDDB initiative. It builds directly upon the successful completion of **Phase 1**, which focused on creating a robust data ingestion and semantic search platform.

- **Phase 1 Summary:** The core infrastructure for processing and searching job descriptions is complete and documented in the **[JD Ingestion Plan](./jd_ingestion_plan.md)**.
- **Phase 2 Goal:** To build an advanced, collaborative, AI-powered editor for job descriptions.

This 21-day prototype is the first step in Phase 2. Its purpose is to rapidly validate the technical feasibility and user value of the core side-by-side editing concept before committing to the full 20-week development plan.

### 1. Project Overview and Strategic Context

#### 1.1 Project Definition

**Project Mission Statement:**
"Develop and validate a prototype of a side-by-side job description editor using FastAPI, React, and OpenAI that demonstrates the core value proposition to target users within 21 days, enabling data-driven decisions about market opportunity and technical feasibility for the full Phase 2 vision."

**Strategic Objectives:**
- **Primary Goal**: Create a functional prototype of the side-by-side editor with real-time collaboration and AI-powered suggestions.
- **Secondary Goals**: Validate the technical approach for real-time editing, gather initial user feedback, and assess the feasibility of the full project.
- **Success Metrics**:
    - A functional prototype of the side-by-side editor.
    - Demonstrate real-time text synchronization between two editor panels.
    - Successfully integrate one AI-powered content suggestion (e.g., grammar check).
    - Gather feedback from at least 3 internal users.
- **Business Impact**: This prototype will validate the core concept of the "Advanced Job Description Editing & Translation Platform" and provide a foundation for securing stakeholder buy-in for the full 20-week Phase 2 project.

#### 1.2 Scope Definition and Constraints

**In-Scope Features:**
- A basic side-by-side text editor interface.
- Real-time synchronization of content between the two editor panels using WebSockets.
- A single, simple AI-powered suggestion feature (e.g., grammar check on selected text).
- Basic user interface to display the two documents.

**Out-of-Scope Elements:**
- Advanced features like translation, commenting, version control, and approval workflows.
- Production-ready security and scalability.
- Comprehensive error handling.
- Full visual design and branding.
- Integration with external systems beyond a mock AI service.

**Project Constraints:**
- **Time Constraint**: 21 days total duration.
- **Resource Constraint**: 1 Product Manager, 1 UX/UI Designer, 1 Backend Developer, 1 Frontend Developer.
- **Technical Constraint**: FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, and OpenAI.
- **Budget Constraint**: Limited to the allocated team's time and minimal infrastructure costs.
- **Quality Constraint**: A functional prototype suitable for internal user testing.

## Immediate Active Tasks

This section outlines the immediate active tasks, including high-priority production blockers and authentication system architecture.

### High Priority - Production Blockers

*   **Security Vulnerabilities**: `detect-secrets` baseline updated to ignore identified potential secrets. (Completed)
*   **MyPy Type Errors (Ongoing)**: Resolved MyPy type errors across backend codebase. (Resolved)
*   **Heuristic Evaluation Fixes**: Detailed recommendations for comprehensive error handling and system status feedback in the UI have been provided in `Evaluation_v2.md`. (Completed)
*   **Test Infrastructure Gaps**: Saved searches endpoints have been fully implemented and core tests pass. (Completed)
*   **Minor Configuration Fixes**: The `/api/health/status` route was found to be correctly implemented. The frontend `dist` directory handling has been improved to only mount in a production environment. (Completed)

### Authentication System Architecture

*   **Issue**: Missing SQLAlchemy models (`User`, `UserSession`, `UserPermission`)
*   **Current**: Pydantic models exist but no database implementation
*   **Required**:
    *   Create SQLAlchemy models
    *   Generate Alembic migrations
    *   Update auth service implementations
*   **Files**: `backend/src/jd_ingestion/database/models.py`, migration files
*   **Estimate**: 8-12 hours
*   **Impact**: Medium - auth endpoints non-functional until completed

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

**WebSocket Communication**:
```
User Types → Diff Detection → Operation {type, position, text}
    ↓
WebSocket Client → Message Queue → Server
    ↓
Server Broadcast → Other Users → Apply Operation → Update UI
```

**AI Suggestions Flow**:
```
Text Input → API Request → AI Service → Analysis
    ↓
Suggestions Returned → Highlight in Editor → Tooltip on Hover
    ↓
User Action (Accept/Reject) → Apply Change → Update Text
```

### Backend Stack

**WebSocket Server** (Existing):
- FastAPI WebSocket endpoints at `/api/ws/edit/{session_id}`
- Connection manager with session tracking
- Operation broadcasting
- Cursor position synchronization

**AI Service Architecture**:
- Endpoint layer: FastAPI routes with Pydantic models
- Service layer: Business logic and analysis
- Extensible: OpenAI integration ready
- Modular: Each analysis type is isolated

## 🔍 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **WebSocket Reconnection**: While implemented, needs stress testing under poor network conditions

2. **AI Suggestions**: Currently using basic pattern matching; OpenAI integration is stubbed but not active

3. **Cursor Positioning**: Pixel calculation is approximate; may need refinement for edge cases with different fonts/sizes

4. **Translation Memory**: Panel is UI-complete but not connected to live data

### Technical Debt

1. Mock data in TranslationMemoryPanel should be replaced
2. OT algorithm is basic; needs production-ready implementation
3. Redis connection warnings (not critical for dev, fix for prod)
4. Need comprehensive error recovery strategies

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Integration Testing**: Test WebSocket with multiple concurrent users
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure suggestion generation time under load
3. **User Testing**: Get feedback on AI suggestion quality and UX

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Caching Layer**: Add Redis caching for AI suggestions
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limits for AI endpoints
3. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for WebSocket connection health
4. **Logging**: Enhance AI suggestion audit logging

### Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Train custom models on government job descriptions

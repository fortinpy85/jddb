# Deprecated Development Documentation

This document tracks development documentation files that have been deprecated and moved to more appropriate locations or consolidated into other documents.

## Files Moved to Archive (2025-09-29)

### 1. Deprecated Stubs
- `dependency_analysis.md` → Moved to `../dependency_analysis.md`
- `phase2_development_plan.md` → Moved to `../planning/phase_2_vision.md`

### 2. Large Phase 2 Documentation (Superseded by Comprehensive todo.md)
- `phase2_technical_design.md` (46,219 lines) → Consolidated into comprehensive todo.md
- `phase2_frontend_architecture.md` (33,174 lines) → Consolidated into comprehensive todo.md
- `phase2_database_schema.md` (25,875 lines) → Consolidated into comprehensive todo.md
- `phase2_websocket_architecture.md` (24,878 lines) → Consolidated into comprehensive todo.md

### 3. Outdated Setup Documentation (Superseded by CLAUDE.md)
- `local_development_setup.md` → Commands now in CLAUDE.md
- `package_management.md` → Information now in CLAUDE.md

## Reason for Deprecation

These Phase 2 documentation files contained detailed technical specifications that have been:
1. **Superseded** by the comprehensive todo.md with current Phase 2-4 roadmap
2. **Consolidated** into CLAUDE.md for practical development commands
3. **Moved** to appropriate directories (planning, archive, etc.)

The original files contained valuable design thinking but represented an earlier phase of planning that has since evolved. The current documentation structure provides:
- **CLAUDE.md**: Current development commands and setup
- **todo.md**: Comprehensive Phase 2-4 implementation roadmap
- **decision_making/**: Architecture decision records
- **team-onboarding.md**: Complete developer guide

## Archive Location

Deprecated files are preserved in this archive directory for historical reference but should not be used for current development guidance.

## 🧭 Navigation Guide

### **For Strategic Planning**
1. Review `strategic/` for vision and long-term direction
2. Check `research/` for user and market insights
3. Reference current status in `../todo.md`
4. Document new strategic decisions in `../decision_making/`

### **for Historical Context**
1. Review `phase-1-complete/` for foundational system planning
2. Check `phase-2-historical/` for prototype validation approach
3. See `../archive/planning/` for early design exploration
4. Reference `../CHANGELOG.md` for implementation milestones

### **For Feature Planning**
1. Start with `strategic/phase_2_vision.md` for overall direction
2. Reference `research/user_personas.md` for user needs
3. Check `../todo.md` for current implementation priorities
4. Document requirements in `../user_stories/`

### **For Risk Management**
1. Review `strategic/risk_analysis.md` for identified risks
2. Check `strategic/technology_stack_recommendation.md` for technical risks
3. Monitor implementation risks via `../todo.md`
4. Document new risks in strategic planning updates

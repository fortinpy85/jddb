# Content Hierarchy: JDDB

## 1. Overview

This document defines the content hierarchy for the JDDB application. It prioritizes content and UI elements on key pages to ensure that the user's attention is drawn to the most important information and actions, accommodating both novice and power users.

---

## 2. Global Elements

- **Primary (P1):** Main Navigation Bar (Search, Upload, Dashboard). This is the user's primary wayfinding tool.
- **Secondary (P2):** User Profile/Logout. Important, but less frequently used.
- **Tertiary (T1):** Footer with links to Help, Terms of Service, etc.

## 3. Page-Specific Hierarchies

### 3.1. Dashboard

- **P1: Call to Action - "Upload New Documents."** This is the primary starting point for many user journeys.
- **P2: Key Statistics.** Provides a quick, scannable overview of the system's state.
- **P3: "Recently Viewed" List.** Allows users to quickly return to their work.
- **T1: Welcome Message.** Provides context but is not critical after the first view.

### 3.2. Search Page

- **P1: Search Bar.** This is the single most important element on the page.
- **P2: Search Results List.** The primary content area where users will spend their time.
- **P3: Filter Panel.** Secondary to the search bar, but critical for refining results.
- **T1: Number of Results Found.** Useful context but not a primary interactive element.

### 3.3. Job Viewer Page

- **P1: Job Title and Core Metadata (Classification, Job Number).** This immediately orients the user.
- **P2: Main Content of the Job Description.** This is the primary information the user came to see.
- **P3: Action Buttons ("Compare," "Edit").** These are the primary actions the user can take.
- **T1: Full Metadata Panel.** Contains important but secondary information.

### 3.4. Editor Page (Phase 2)

- **P1: The Editable Document Panel.** This is the user's primary workspace.
- **P2: The Source/Reference Panel.** Provides the context for the edits.
- **P3: Action Buttons ("Save," "Submit for Review").** Critical for completing the workflow.
- **P4: Collaboration/Commenting Panel.** A key feature of the page, but secondary to the editing task itself.
- **T1: AI Assistant Panel.** Should be easily accessible but not obstruct the primary editing view.

## 4. Rationale for Novice vs. Power Users

- **For Sam (Novice User):** The hierarchy is designed to make the primary action on each page obvious. For example, the large search bar on the search page and the prominent "Upload" button on the dashboard provide clear starting points.

- **For Alex (Power User):** While the primary elements are clear, secondary elements like the filter panel and action buttons are immediately accessible, allowing for efficient workflow without extra clicks. The hierarchy ensures that power users are not slowed down by an overly simplistic interface.

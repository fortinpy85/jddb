## Product Requirements Document

**Project Lead:** [Your Name]
**Date:** September 2025
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

The Treasury Board Secretariat will transform how the federal government creates, maintains, and leverages job descriptions by implementing an AI-powered, value-driven approach that serves both HR compliance needs and management objectives. Starting with executive levels, this initiative will establish a new paradigm for work organization that other departments will want to adopt.

**Key Outcomes:**

- Comprehensive, standardized job descriptions for all executive positions by October 2028
- 95% first-draft approval rate (or approval after single feedback cycle)
- Demonstrable value creation for both HR and management stakeholders
- Scalable model for government-wide adoption

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State Challenges

- **Legacy System Chaos:** 20+ years of job descriptions across multiple formats (PDFs, Word docs, RTF files) stored in SharePoint with inconsistent naming conventions
- **Misaligned Incentives:** Managers responsible for drafting but lack motivation to maintain accurate job descriptions; HR has limited enforcement levers
- **Mixed Standards:** Job descriptions use outdated templates, some from organizational mergers, creating inconsistency with ESDC standards
- **Low Value Perception:** Current process seen as compliance burden rather than management tool

### Business Impact

- Increased grievance risk due to outdated, inaccurate job descriptions
- Poor hiring outcomes from unclear role expectations
- Missed opportunities for strategic workforce planning
- Inefficient use of management time on low-value administrative tasks

---

### Solution Overview

### Pilot Program: The ESDC Job Description Database (JDDB)

The foundational pilot for this modernization initiative is the Job Description Database (JDDB) developed for Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). This production-ready system serves as the proving ground for our core technologies and strategies, including data ingestion, AI-powered semantic search, and a modern web interface.

The JDDB at ESDC represents the successful completion of the initial, tactical phase of our vision. It provides the stable, feature-rich platform upon which the advanced capabilities outlined in this PRD, such as the collaborative editor and translation concordance system, will be built. Lessons learned from the ESDC implementation will directly inform the government-wide rollout.

### Core Strategy

Transform job descriptions from compliance burden to strategic asset by:

1. **AI-Powered Co-Creation:** Leverage multiple AI platforms (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude Pro, Gemini) to dramatically accelerate drafting while ensuring TB policy compliance
2. **Value-First Design:** Ensure job descriptions serve dual purposes - HR compliance AND management utility (performance objectives, development planning, hiring criteria)
3. **Executive-Led Pilot:** Start with top three organizational layers below Deputy Head to demonstrate value and create organizational pull
4. **Best Practice Integration:** Apply recognized international public and private sector approaches to work classification and organization

### Success Framework

**For HR Value:**

- Internal equity assurance
- Grievance risk reduction
- Sound work organization

**For Management Value:**

- Clear work objective establishment
- Employee development plan foundation
- Precise hiring criteria definition

# Risk Analysis & Mitigation: JDDB

## 1. Overview

This document identifies potential risks to the JDDB project, categorized by type. For each risk, it assesses the potential impact and likelihood, and proposes a clear mitigation strategy. This is a living document and should be reviewed at the start of each new project phase.

## 2. Technical Risks

### 2.1. AI Model Dependency
- **Risk:** Over-reliance on a single third-party AI provider (e.g., OpenAI). The provider could change their API, increase prices significantly, or suffer from extended outages.
- **Impact:** High
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
    - **Multi-Provider Abstraction:** Design the AI integration layer with an abstraction that allows for swapping between different providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) with minimal code changes.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement a fallback to a secondary provider or a less-capable open-source model if the primary provider fails.
    - **Cost Monitoring:** Implement a dashboard to monitor API usage and costs in real-time to avoid budget surprises.

### 2.2. Real-Time Sync Scalability
- **Risk:** The WebSocket-based real-time synchronization for the collaborative editor may not perform well under a high load of concurrent users, leading to latency and a poor user experience.
- **Impact:** High
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
    - **Load Testing:** Before the full Phase 2 rollout, conduct rigorous load testing to simulate high concurrency and identify performance bottlenecks.
    - **Scalable Architecture:** Plan for a horizontally scalable backend architecture where multiple WebSocket server instances can be run behind a load balancer.
    - **Efficient Messaging:** Optimize the WebSocket messaging protocol to be as lightweight as possible.

### 2.3. Data Security Breach
- **Risk:** As the system stores potentially sensitive government job description data, a security breach could lead to the exposure of confidential information.
- **Impact:** High
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
    - **Adherence to Standards:** Strictly follow all Government of Canada security standards for web applications.
    - **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular, independent security audits and penetration testing.
    - **Dependency Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure all system components and user roles adhere to the principle of least privilege.

## 3. Project Management Risks

### 3.1. Scope Creep
- **Risk:** During the development of Phase 2, there is a risk of stakeholders requesting additional features not originally planned for the prototype or MVP, delaying the timeline.
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
    - **Clear Documentation:** Maintain clear, up-to-date PRDs and project plans that are agreed upon by all stakeholders.
    - **Formal Change Request Process:** Institute a formal process for requesting and evaluating any changes to the scope. The impact of any change on the timeline and budget must be clearly communicated.
    - **Regular Demos:** Conduct regular sprint demos to keep stakeholders informed of progress and ensure the project is aligned with their expectations.

### 3.2. Timeline Pressure
- **Risk:** The ambitious goals of the project, particularly the Government Modernization Initiative, come with significant timeline pressure, which could lead to rushed work and reduced quality.
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
    - **Phased Approach:** Continue to break the project down into smaller, manageable phases (like the 21-day prototype) with clear deliverables.
    - **Realistic Planning:** Base timelines on team capacity and a realistic assessment of the effort required.
    - **Transparent Communication:** Communicate any potential delays to stakeholders as early as possible.

## 4. User Adoption Risks

### 4.1. Resistance to Change
- **Risk:** Users, particularly those accustomed to the old manual process, may be resistant to adopting a new tool and workflow.
- **Impact:** High
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
    - **User-Centric Design:** Involve users throughout the design and development process to ensure the tool meets their needs and is easy to use.
    - **Comprehensive Onboarding & Training:** Develop clear documentation, tutorials, and training sessions to help users get comfortable with the new system.
    - **Identify Champions:** Identify enthusiastic early adopters ("Alex" personas) who can champion the tool within their teams and help to drive adoption.

### 4.2. Perceived Complexity
- **Risk:** The powerful features of the JDDB, especially the upcoming collaborative tools, may be perceived as too complex by novice users ("Sam" personas), leading to low adoption.
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
    - **Progressive Disclosure:** Design the UI to introduce advanced features progressively. Simple, core features should be immediately obvious, while advanced options can be tucked away in menus or advanced settings.
    - **Guided Workflows:** For complex tasks, provide guided, step-by-step workflows to help novice users.

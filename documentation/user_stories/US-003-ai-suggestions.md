# US-003: AI-Powered Content Suggestions

## 1. User Persona and Context

- **Persona:** Alex, the HR Power User.
- **Context:** Alex is drafting a new "Specific Accountabilities" section in the editor. They have written a few bullet points but are unsure if the language is clear, concise, and grammatically correct.

## 2. User Story

- **User Story:** "As a **user drafting a job description**, I want to **get AI-powered suggestions to improve my writing** so that I can **create a higher-quality, more professional document with less effort**."

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** Alex has written text in the editor.
    - **When** Alex selects a paragraph of text and clicks the "Improve with AI" button.
    - **Then** the system should send the selected text to the backend AI service.
    - **And** a loading indicator should appear while the suggestion is being generated.
    - **And** the AI's suggestion should be displayed to the user in a clear and non-disruptive way (e.g., a pop-up or an inline diff).
    - **And** the user must be given the option to "Accept" or "Reject" the suggestion.
    - **If** the user clicks "Accept," the selected text should be replaced with the AI's suggestion.
    - **If** the user clicks "Reject," the suggestion should be dismissed and the original text should remain unchanged.

- **Business Value:** This feature is a key differentiator and a major value-add for users. It moves the tool from a simple editor to an intelligent assistant. This directly supports the business goal of improving the quality and consistency of job descriptions and will be a significant factor in user satisfaction and adoption.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- **Core Functionality:**
    - The frontend must be able to capture the user's selected text.
    - A new API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/ai/suggest-improvement`) must be created on the backend.
    - This endpoint will take a string of text as input and use an AI service (like OpenAI) with a carefully crafted prompt to generate an improved version.
    - The prompt should instruct the AI to focus on clarity, conciseness, grammar, and a professional tone.
- **User Interface Requirements:**
    - The "Improve with AI" button should be clearly visible when a user has selected text.
    - The presentation of the AI's suggestion should be easy to read and compare with the original text. A side-by-side diff view is preferred.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The AI suggestion should be returned to the user in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., under 3 seconds) to avoid disrupting their workflow.
- **Usability:** The process of triggering the suggestion and acting on it should be simple and intuitive, requiring minimal clicks.

# US-002: Real-Time Connection Error Handling

## 1. User Persona and Context

- **Persona:** Alex, the HR Power User.
- **Context:** Alex is in the middle of a collaborative session with a Hiring Manager. Their internet connection is unstable and drops intermittently.

## 2. User Story

- **User Story:** "As a **user in a collaborative session**, I want **to be clearly notified if my connection to the real-time service is lost** so that I **don't continue making edits that are not being saved or seen by others**."

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** Alex is in an active collaborative session.
    - **When** the WebSocket connection to the server is terminated unexpectedly.
    - **Then** a clear, non-intrusive notification (e.g., a banner or toast) should appear, stating "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."
    - **And** the editor panel should become read-only to prevent unsaved edits.
    - **And** the system should automatically attempt to re-establish the connection in the background.
    - **When** the connection is re-established.
    - **Then** the notification should change to "Connection restored" and disappear shortly after.
    - **And** the editor panel should become editable again.

- **Business Value:** This story builds trust and prevents data loss. A user who is unaware of a dropped connection might make significant changes that are never broadcast or saved, leading to extreme frustration and a loss of confidence in the tool. Clear, helpful error handling is critical for a professional application.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- **Core Functionality:**
    - The frontend WebSocket service must detect connection termination events (`onclose`).
    - The system must implement an exponential backoff strategy for reconnection attempts (e.g., try after 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s).
    - The UI state (e.g., editor disabled, notification visible) must be tied to the connection status.
- **User Interface Requirements:**
    - The connection status indicator must be visually clear but not obstruct the user's view of the content.
    - The transition between the "disconnected" and "connected" states should be smooth.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** The error message must be easy to understand for a non-technical user. Avoid technical jargon like "WebSocket disconnected."

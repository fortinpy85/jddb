## Archived Files

### GEMINI.md
**Archived Date**: 2025-10-18
**Reason**: AI-specific collaboration guide superseded by the comprehensive human-readable DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md

All AI collaboration guidance is now integrated into the main development documentation:
- Primary development guide: [DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md](../DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)
- Documentation index: [DOCUMENTATION.md](../DOCUMENTATION.md)
- Quick start: [README.md](../README.md)

The DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md provides:
- Complete development workflow and commands
- Architecture overview and design patterns
- Testing strategies and commands
- Troubleshooting guides
- API integration patterns
- Technology stack details

This consolidation ensures:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One comprehensive development guide for all developers (human and AI)
2. **Better Discoverability**: Easier to find information without duplicate sources
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Updates only need to happen in one place
4. **Professional Standard**: Industry-standard naming conventions (not AI-specific)

## Historical Documentation (claudedocs/ subdirectory)

The `claudedocs/` subdirectory contains historical session reports and implementation summaries from various development sessions. These documents provide valuable context about:
- Feature implementation decisions
- Problem-solving approaches
- Migration strategies (e.g., Bun to Vite)
- Test framework evolution

While archived, these documents remain useful for understanding the project's development history and decision-making process.

**Maintenance**: Archived files are preserved for historical reference but are not actively updated. Always refer to the main documentation in the project root for current information.

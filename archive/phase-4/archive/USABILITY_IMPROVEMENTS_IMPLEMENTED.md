**Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Critical Usability Fixes
**Status**: ✅ 4 of 6 planned improvements completed

---

---

## Completed Improvements

### ✅ P0 Critical #1: Dashboard Sidebar Only on Dashboard Tab

**Problem**: Dashboard statistics panel appeared on all tabs, wasting 30% of screen space and cluttering task-focused views.

**Severity**: 4/4 (Catastrophic) - Violated user requirement to "limit distracting, unrelated or irrelevant information"

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `src/app/page.tsx:167` to conditionally render sidebar only on dashboard view
- Separated "Dashboard" view from "Jobs" (home) view
- Updated all navigation mappings to distinguish between Dashboard and Jobs tabs

**Files Changed**:
```typescript
// src/app/page.tsx
const showDashboardSidebar = activeView === "dashboard";  // Only show on dashboard!

// Added dedicated dashboard view
case "dashboard":
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <StatsDashboard />
    </div>
  );
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Jobs, Upload, Search, Compare, Translate, Improve tabs now use full width
- ✅ Workspace increased by 30% on task-focused views
- ✅ Dashboard content only appears where it's relevant and useful
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load and visual clutter

**Validation**:
- Navigate to Jobs tab: No sidebar ✓
- Navigate to Upload tab: No sidebar ✓
- Navigate to Dashboard tab: Sidebar appears ✓

### ✅ P0 Critical #2: Added "Improve" Tab to Navigation

**Problem**: Core user workflow (AI-powered job improvement) not accessible from main navigation.

**Severity**: 4/4 (Catastrophic) - Core functionality missing from interface

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added "Improve" tab to `src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx`
- Positioned strategically in workflow: Dashboard → Jobs → Upload → **Improve** → Search → Compare → Translate
- Used Wand2 icon to indicate AI-powered functionality
- Connected to existing `ImprovementView` component

**Files Changed**:
```typescript
// src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx
{
  id: "improve",
  label: "Improve",
  icon: Wand2,
  description: "AI-powered improvements",
}

// src/app/page.tsx
case "improve":
  if (selectedJob) {
    handleViewChange("improvement");
  } else {
    handleViewChange("home"); // Prompt to select job first
  }
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ "Improve" tab visible in main navigation
- ✅ Workflow sequence now clear and logical
- ✅ Users can access AI improvements directly
- ✅ Supports stated user requirement for "system-recommended improvements"

**Validation**:
- Click "Improve" tab without job selected: Redirects to Jobs ✓
- Click "Improve" tab with job selected: Opens ImprovementView ✓

---

### ✅ P0 Critical #3: Workflow Progress Indicator

**Problem**: Users didn't know their position in the multi-step improvement workflow.

**Severity**: 4/4 (Catastrophic) - No visual indication of workflow progress

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created new component: `src/components/ui/workflow-stepper.tsx`
- 4-step visual progress: Upload → Review → Improve → Export
- Integrated into `JobDetailView` (review step) and `ImprovementView` (improve step)
- Shows completed steps with checkmarks, current step with highlighting

**Files Created/Changed**:
```typescript
// src/components/ui/workflow-stepper.tsx (NEW)
export function WorkflowStepper({
  currentStep,
  completedSteps = [],
}) {
  // Visual stepper with icons, labels, progress line
}

// src/components/jobs/JobDetailView.tsx
<WorkflowStepper
  currentStep="review"
  completedSteps={["upload"]}
/>

// src/components/improvement/ImprovementView.tsx
<WorkflowStepper
  currentStep="improve"
  completedSteps={["upload", "review"]}
/>
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Users see clear visual progress through workflow
- ✅ Completed steps marked with checkmarks
- ✅ Current step highlighted with ring animation
- ✅ Reduces confusion about "what comes next"
- ✅ Mobile-responsive with adaptive descriptions

**Validation**:
- View job detail: Progress shows "Review" step ✓
- Enter Improve mode: Progress shows "Improve" step ✓
- Completed steps show checkmarks ✓

---

### ✅ P1 High Priority #4: Unsaved Changes Warning

**Problem**: No protection against accidental data loss when navigating away from improvements.

**Severity**: 3/4 (Major) - Risk of losing significant user work

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created reusable hook: `src/hooks/useUnsavedChanges.ts`
- Integrated into `ImprovementView` component
- Browser beforeunload event protection
- Custom navigation confirmation dialog
- Visual "Unsaved Changes" badge in header

**Files Created/Changed**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useUnsavedChanges.ts (NEW)
export function useUnsavedChanges({
  hasUnsavedChanges,
  message,
  enabled = true,
}) {
  // Browser beforeunload protection
  // Navigation confirmation
}

// src/components/improvement/ImprovementView.tsx
const { confirmNavigation } = useUnsavedChanges({
  hasUnsavedChanges: improvement.hasPendingChanges || improvement.hasChanges,
  message: "You have unsaved improvements. Are you sure you want to leave?",
});

// Visual indicator
{(improvement.hasPendingChanges || improvement.hasChanges) && (
  <Badge variant="outline" className="text-amber-600">
    Unsaved Changes
  </Badge>
)}
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Prevents accidental data loss
- ✅ Warns before browser tab close/refresh
- ✅ Confirms before navigating away
- ✅ Visual indicator of unsaved state
- ✅ Reusable hook for other components

**Validation**:
- Make changes in Improve view: Badge appears ✓
- Click Back button: Confirmation dialog ✓
- Try to close browser tab: Browser warning ✓
- Save changes: Badge disappears ✓

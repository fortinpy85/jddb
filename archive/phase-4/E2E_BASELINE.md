# Phase 4: E2E Test Baseline Established

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Baseline Established
**Pass Rate:** 46% (6/13 tests passing)

---

## üìä Summary

Successfully established baseline E2E test coverage for Phase 4 using Playwright. Created comprehensive critical-path test suite covering the three essential user flows identified in the Phase 4 plan.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Infrastructure Issues**
   - Updated `src/index.tsx` to respect `PORT` environment variable
   - Playwright can now run tests on port 3002 without conflicts
   - Test server starts successfully with `bun dev`

2. **Created Critical Path Test Suite**
   - New file: `tests/critical-paths.spec.ts`
   - 13 comprehensive tests covering:
     - Dashboard view and navigation (3 tests)
     - Search to job detail flow (3 tests)
     - File upload and verification (5 tests)
     - Error handling (2 tests)

3. **Updated Test Selectors**
   - Fixed ARIA role issues (navigation uses buttons, not tabs)
   - Updated all tests to use correct selectors
   - Added accessibility notes for future improvements

---

## ‚úÖ Passing Tests (6/13)

### Dashboard & Navigation
1. ‚úÖ **should navigate between tabs successfully** - Verifies all navigation buttons are clickable and functional
2. ‚úÖ **should use quick actions to navigate** - Tests quick action buttons for navigation

### File Upload Flow
3. ‚úÖ **should show file size limits** - Verifies file size information is displayed
4. ‚úÖ **should display batch upload options** - Confirms batch upload UI is present
5. ‚úÖ **should have accessible file input for upload** - Validates file input accessibility

### Error Handling
6. ‚úÖ **should handle missing backend gracefully on dashboard** - Ensures app doesn't crash without backend

---

## ‚ùå Failing Tests (7/13) - Needs Investigation

### Dashboard Stats (1 test)
- **should load dashboard and display core elements**
  - Issue: Stats not displaying (mocked API might not match current implementation)
  - Next: Check StatsDashboard component and API response format

### Search Flow (3 tests)
- **should perform search and navigate to job details**
- **should filter search results by classification**
- **should handle empty search results gracefully**
  - Issue: Search input not found - selector `input[placeholder*="search"]` not matching
  - Next: Inspect SearchInterface component to find correct selector

### Upload Flow (2 tests)
- **should display upload interface with instructions**
  - Issue: Dropzone text mismatch
  - Next: Update assertions to match current UI text
- **should show upload status area**
  - Issue: File input is hidden (correct for accessibility, but test expects visible)
  - Next: Update test to check for hidden input or browse button

### Error Handling (1 test)
- **should handle API errors gracefully in search**
  - Issue: Cannot interact with search (same as search flow issue)
  - Next: Fix search selector first

## üîß Infrastructure Fixes Applied

### 1. Port Configuration (src/index.tsx:8-12)
```typescript
function main() {
  const port = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) : 3000;

  const server = serve({
    port,
    routes: {
      // ... routes
    },
  });
}
```

**Why:** Playwright config sets `PORT=3002` but code wasn't reading it, causing EADDRINUSE errors.

### 2. Test Selectors Updated
**Before:**
```typescript
await page.getByRole("tab", { name: "Search" }).click();
```

**After:**
```typescript
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Search", exact: false }).click();
```

**Why:** AppHeader uses Button components, not proper ARIA tabs. Added note for accessibility improvements.

## üéØ Critical Path Coverage

### Path 1: Dashboard View and Navigation ‚úÖ (Partially)
- **Goal:** User can load dashboard and navigate between views
- **Status:** 2/3 passing
- **Working:** Navigation between views via buttons and quick actions
- **Needs Fix:** Stats display verification

### Path 2: Search to Job Detail Flow ‚ùå (Needs Work)
- **Goal:** User can search for jobs and view details
- **Status:** 0/3 passing
- **Blocker:** Search input selector not matching current UI
- **Next Step:** Inspect SearchInterface component structure

### Path 3: File Upload and Verification ‚úÖ (Mostly)
- **Goal:** User can upload files through UI
- **Status:** 4/5 passing
- **Working:** File size limits, batch options, accessible file input
- **Needs Fix:** Dropzone text assertions

---

## üìù Test Infrastructure Details

### Playwright Configuration (playwright.config.ts)
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:3002`
- **Test Directory:** `./tests`
- **Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari, Edge
- **Parallel Execution:** Enabled
- **Retries (CI):** 2
- **Timeout:** 60 seconds per test
- **Screenshots:** On failure
- **Video:** Retained on failure

### Test Utilities
- **API Mocking:** Tests mock backend responses to avoid dependencies
- **Route Interception:** Uses `page.route()` for API call simulation
- **Error Handling:** Tests verify graceful degradation

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Fix Failing Tests)
1. **Search Flow** - Inspect SearchInterface to find correct input selector
2. **Dashboard Stats** - Verify StatsDashboard component and mock data format
3. **Upload UI** - Update text assertions to match current implementation

### Short-term (Enhance Coverage)
1. Add tests for job details view interaction
2. Add tests for job comparison functionality
3. Add tests for translation workflow

### Long-term (Accessibility)
1. **Add proper ARIA roles** to navigation (buttons should be tabs)
   - Current: `<Button>` elements
   - Should be: `<button role="tab" aria-selected={isActive}>`
2. **Integrate axe-core** for automated accessibility checks (Phase 4 Task #2)
3. **Add keyboard navigation tests**

## üêõ Known Issues

### 1. Navigation ARIA Roles
**Issue:** Navigation buttons don't have `role="tab"` attributes
**Location:** `src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx:212-237`
**Impact:** Tests must use button selectors instead of semantic tab roles
**Solution:** Add proper ARIA tab roles in AppHeader component

### 2. Search Interface Selector
**Issue:** Search input not found with `input[placeholder*="search"]`
**Location:** Unknown - needs inspection of SearchInterface component
**Impact:** All search flow tests failing
**Solution:** Find correct selector or update SearchInterface to use standard placeholder

### 3. File Input Visibility
**Issue:** File input has `class="hidden"` for accessibility (visually hidden but screen-reader accessible)
**Location:** Upload component
**Impact:** Test expecting visible input fails
**Solution:** Update test to check for input existence, not visibility

## üéØ Phase 4 Integration

This baseline establishes the foundation for:

1. **Task #2:** Accessibility checks with axe-core (navigation ARIA roles identified)
2. **Task #3:** Create New Job workflow testing (infrastructure ready)
3. **Task #4:** System Health page testing (infrastructure ready)
4. **Task #5:** User Preferences page testing (infrastructure ready)

All future features should have E2E tests added to `tests/critical-paths.spec.ts` following the established patterns.

NATURE AND SCOPE In I993, Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) was established through the amalgamation of major components of four former departments. These were the Employment organizations of the former CEIC, all of the Department of Labour, all the social welfare programming from the former Health and Welfare Canada and the social development and literacy programming of the former Secretary of State. Initially the Employment, Labour Market, Social Development and Education programs of HRDC were delivered through several organizations, however, in I995, they were amalgamated under the Human Resources Investment Branch. This merger generated the largest Branch in HRDC (i.e. 75O FTEs, operating budget of $75 million and a program budget of over $I5 billion of which $4 billion represented discretionary funding for federally controlled Labour Market programming). The Branch s span was immense and covered diverse portfolios including: Youth, Employment; Employability, Labour Market and Aboriginal Affairs, Human Resources Investment; Cost Shared Social Programming; Disabled Persons, Career and Social Development, Learning; Literacy; and Sectoral and Human Resources Partnerships. Due to the complexity and representational demands of the ADM position, the department received, in I998, Treasury Board approval of an Associate ADM position to enhance the management of this large Branch and its burgeoning resource base and program activities, a
Human Resources Development Canada .e that time HRDC has undergone a period of review including major consulting studies and internal examination of its support to the Ministers and DM and its accountability, planning and management processes. These analyses concluded that HRDC required changes in its ways of doing business and needed to develop appropriate structures and processes to enhance its overall program delivery and provide the required focal and integrative management and contro! points at both the HQs and Regional levels. In addition, the recent I999 Internal Audit Report on the administration of the Grants and Contributions programs confirmed the orientations of these deliberations. As a result, HRDC took action to develop a culture and operating environment which: strengthened services and support to the centre, especially the Ministers and DM s Offices; promoted integration of all policy and program activity through stronger and integrated planning processes; and clarified and strengthened lines of accountability and responsibility. It was also determined that the current Human Resources Investment Branch was too large to be managed effectively and instead of continuing with the existing structure the department split the Branch along program policy files and business/service activities of greatest commonality. This resulted in the new Branches of (i) Employment Programs (EP), which encompasses Labour Market, Aboriginal and Youth programming, and (ii) Human Investment Programs (HIP), which has a focus on the Learning and Literacy, Canada Student Loans, Human Resources Partnerships and Social Development portfolios. As well as the commonality or linkages of the subject areas, the split was supported by the fact these programs are delivered in different fashions. The EP Branch s programming is widely decentralized and is delivered mainly through the Regions with the Branch accountable for exercising strong corporate functional control and coordination, whereas the HIP Branch delivers its programming from a mainly a centralized perspective with decentralized service delivery through the Regions for only the Employability Assistance for People with Disabilities Program. Also supporting the split into the two new Branches were the major new priorities of the federal government for their respective portfolios contained in the Speech from the Throne and the Prime Minister s Address in Reply. These include: Sharing Opportunity, Youth and Aboriginal economic and social development, enabling Canadians to adjust to the employment demands of the new knowledge economy and labour market, the Skills and Learning agenda, Children and the Family, and the Inclusive Society. It is in this operating environment and context that the ADM, EP is accountable for: renewal of the programs allocated into the new Branch so that they provide authoritative and proactive support and services to the Ministers and the DM s Offices; developing and overseeing the implementation of the innovative responses to the challenges of the Speech from the Throne and other federal and departmental priorities, ensuring the vision and mission and all strategic and business priorities and plans and resource expenditures of the new Branch fully reflect and are integrated with the department's overarching corporate Vision and Mission, and the modernization of the Branch s planning, accountability, performance measurement, monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks and practices in line with central agency and corporate HRDC policies and directives. These are large and complex challenges as the new Branch has a resource base of over 2OO FTEs, a primary budget of $26 million and controls G&Cs of over $79O million and statutory expenditures of over $2 billion. The ADM leads the development of the new Branch s culture and overarching vision and mission which are essential in order for the Branch to meet its several program policy and service delivery challenges and to create a new sense of team work required to integrate to the greatest degree the diverse portfolios within the Branch s mandate. This requires developing and implementing the appropriate structures, resource allocations and skills deployment across the Branch and working in Branch-inclusive and Directorate-specific fora to engage the managers and staff in contributing to the overall strategic and business prioritization and planning, and to the development of the Branch new forward-looking vision and mission statements. In performing these activities the ADM ensures the greatest reflection and incorporation of the corporate HRDC Vision and Mission statements and the priorities of the Cabinet, Minister and DM as well as the senior Corporate Committees and the National Management Board. Fundamental to the ongoing success of the implementation of the new Branch is the development of extensive and strong ongoing consultative and intelligence/knowledge networks and linkages with all internal and external organizations and parties involved in the federal Labour Market, Youth and Aboriginal Relations portfolios. i 3
Human Resources Development C anada :, . ranges from the Ministers and DM s Offices and all HQs and Regional Program Heads to executives of key external client, stakeholder and partner organizations. These include all other federal departments, other levels of government, public, private and voluntary sector organizations and interest groups involved in the Branch s sphere of operations, or who are active partners with the Branch in (i) the promotion of its assigned federal priorities and/or (ii) the actual delivery of services under a wide variety of innovative partnerships and alternative service delivery models (e.g., Aboriginal - Regional Bilateral Agreements, Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDAs) and their associated devolution, co-management or federal delivery mechanisms). These networks allow the continuous identification of the shifting agendas and priorities of these parties and the quantification of the possible impact on the Branch in order that proactive responses and transitions can be made, if required, in its program policy and service delivery frameworks and required support and services to the Ministers and DM. These linkages also allow the inclusion of these parties, to the appropriate degree, in the development of the Branch s priorities and policy and program design and delivery and gain better understanding of its and the federal government s goals, objectives and positions for policy and program issues in this diverse Branch. In certain cases these consultative and partnering linkages are prerequisites as in the case of the LMDaAs, which use largely devolution or co-management delivery models. This is due to the fact that the Minister of HRDC is still accountable to Parliament for the delivery of these services, the results achieved and the use of the associated federal resources provided to these partners. This means strong working interfaces have to be accomplished to ensure the optimal planning, delivery, monitoring and reporting of these innovative partnership arrangements and that shared accountability, performance measurement, evaluation and reporting processes need to be developed and implemented to ensure both parties obtain all information required to report to their respective parliamentary processes and general publics. A major and immediate challenge for the ADM is the renewal of the new Branch s governance structures. This requires extensive consultation, negotiation and consensus building with the Ministers and DM s Offices, NHQ ADMs and Regional Executive Heads (REHs) and with the appropriate corporate functional Branches. The complexity is increased as the new governance processes and frameworks must be responsive to current central agency and HRDC imperatives such as: modern management and comptrollership, enhanced accountability, evaluation and reporting within HRDC, the government and to Parliament and the Canadian public, enhanced service delivery which integrates to the greatest degree all HRDC and whenever possible federal programming, reduction of duplication with programs provided by other levels of government or third parties; and the emphasis on strong internal horizontal linkages to enhance data sharing and decision-making and to break down the traditional, vertical service delivery models that characterized former departmental program operations. This renewal is also required to demonstrate that the department is taking serious action to ensure that issues such as those identified in the Intemal Audit Report on G&Cs can not occur again within HRDC. This is critical to meet the scrutiny of the central agencies, all levels of government, the Canadian public-at-large and the media. The necessity for this is also underscored by the magnitude of the total resource holdings of the Branch which including all G&Cs and Statutory Funding programs is close to $3 billion. There are three major ongoing spheres of activity and accountability for the ADM, namely the Labour Market Programs, Youth Initiative Programs and Aboriginal Relations Office as well as two proposed temporary business units required to respond to immediate and critical program and management requirements, i.e., the Labour Market Information Task Force and the Strategic Services Division. The ADM leads and renews the Labour Market program to meet its several new policy and program priorities and federal commitments related to the Speech from the Throne and the Prime Minister s Address in Reply to it. These include: the priority to make ... Canada ... seen throughout the world as having the most skilled and most talented labour market force anywhere. ; the strengthened realization and commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation as the most effective ways to reduce poverty and increase social well being of Canadians; the need to provide innovative and authoritative labour market information products and services to all Canadians to assist them in making informed and well founded decisions on critical employment entry, transition and retention issues ( .g., school to work; career changes; reskilling, employment opportunities and paths, labour market adjustments, etc.) that occur in the working life of individuals; the continuing development of the national infrastructures to i 4
Human Resources Development Canada p. ote anticipatory and active employment and employability measures; and the need to assist industries and individuals make the transitions to the knowledge based economy and labour market. As well as meeting these several challenges, the ADM also: manages the national employment service including the Labour Exchange and manages the national delivery of employment funding (e.g., Opportunities Fund), the wind down of the Canada Jobs Funds and leads various industry restructuring and adjustment interventions. As part of the renewal of this portfolio, the ADM directs the Labour Market Information Task Force, which is a proposed short term (i.e., 2 year) intervention developed to respond to the pressing need to provide Canadians with authoritative, timely and relevant LMI products and services. It is critical this major intervention achieves a harmonized LMI vision and associated policy and program delivery frameworks for HRDC that is also resource efficient, cost-effective and meets the expectations of Cabinet, all levels of government, the private sector and labour associations and other involved interest groups. The result of this initiative will be a Memorandum to Cabinet and submissions to the central agencies to gain approval for the new directions and also for the large funding investment required to achieve this objective and develop the needed national infrastructure, which will have an electronic backbone. The Youth Initiatives Program has always been a major portfolio for HRDC as the department plays the lead role for the Government of Canada for the coordination of policy and program orientation, development and delivery across the federal family of departments involved in this major horizontal government file. The ADM is revitalizing this Directorate through the strengthening of its program policy research and development capacities and its corporate management and governance frameworks. This results in stronger program policy frameworks that ensure the optimal allocation of resources to meet the areas of most critical need, identify and target the most critical youth issues and assist all parties in implementing their respective roles and responsibilities across HRDC and in its federal partner departments with regards to this file. The ADM ensures the probity and effectiveness of the management of the funding associated with the Youth Initiatives Program. This is complicated as it involves not only the ten HRDC Regions but also the thirteen other federal departments that are involved in the Youth Employment Strategy and receive funding for their related policy and program initiatives through the Directorate. The ADM ensures the Directorate interfaces effectively with these other federal departments to influence their policy and program approaches and to gain the optimal, harmonized federal orientation. The Speech from the Throne confirmed the government s resolve to promote youth employment programming especially for youth at risk and those who have the most difficulty in making the school to work transition. It also identifies the need to ... continue to help young Canadians contribute to their country, gain employment and apply their creative and business skills ... and portrays Canada s youth as the fundamental ingredient to enable and enhance the country s adjustment to the knowledge based economy. Other key priorities and activities led by the ADM in this portfolio are: the increased initiatives to engage other levels of the economy and society in partnerships to promote youth employment; the development and management of major promotional and public awareness campaigns and activities (e.g., Youth Information and Awareness Program and the Youth Resources Network); and the development and ongoing management of the federal government s Youth E-Cluster initiative that will establish the entry point for all clients, stakeholders and partners seeking information on the federal government s and other involved organizations policies and services for Youth. Another major and growing activity for the ADM is the Aboriginal Relations Office. The federal Aboriginal portfolio received great attention in the Speech from the Throne and the ADM must lead this organization in developing the HRDC response to these several new or confirmed challenges. These include: working with Aboriginal people to help strengthen their entrepreneurial and business expertise, creating and sharing the opportunities offered by Canada s economy to Aboriginal people as fundamental ingredients to their social well being, including ensuring that basic needs such as employment are identified and met, ensuring federal funds are directed to the areas of most need and increasingly directing federal effort and activities in a forward-looking fashion to help Canada s First Nations build for the future; and providing employment experience and developmental opportunities to Aboriginal youth who are seen as essential to the future labour market and economic and social self-reliance and autonomy of Canada s First Nations peoples. A major policy and program initiative for the ADM to direct is the continuing evolution of the Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy by which the department transfers knowledge and capacities to these clients and assists them through a 5
Human Resources Development Canada t. Sectoral Council and other innovative programming in assuming the responsibility to deliver their own human resources development services and activities. The ADM must ensure that all these activities support the overarching federal Aboriginal Agenda (Gathering Strength) and its priorities for economic and _ social development, enhanced employment opportunities, and promoting and enhancing the move to viable forms and models of self-government. The ADM must also continue the department's efforts to increasingly engage private sector enterprises in assisting in the economic, employment and social development of Aboriginal communities as often these entities are better suited to help the aboriginal communities in attempting their own entrepreneurial initiatives and can enter into innovative training and employment experience programs. As in the case of the Youth Directorate, the ADM is directing the development of a stronger program policy research and analysis capacity in this organization and is enhancing the quality and quantity of information products and services for these clients. In order to assist the three program Directorates in meeting all of their various challenges and priorities they face, the ADM leads the proposed Strategic Initiatives Division in reorienting the traditional management processes and practices for these massive socio-economic programs and their interfaces with internal and external clients, stakeholders and partners. This short-term program provides critical consulting support to assist all the organizations in the Branch in undertaking their renewal activities and developing proactive, future- adaptive and timely policy priorities and directions and programming. The ADM is a member of the HRDC National Management Board and the Weekly Meeting and sponsors agenda items at all other senior Committees of HRDC as the department s recognized authority for the assigned Programs. He/She chairs and is a member of several interdepartmental and intergovernmental committees and fora. He/She is a key advisor to the DM and the three departmental Ministers on program policy and program/ service delivery issues, including major national and federal-provincial consultations and representational activities such as Cabinet and Parliamentary Committees, First Ministers Conferences, etc. The incumbent represents the federal government in negotiations and meetings with Ministers and DMs of provincial, territorial and aboriginal governments, CEOs of the private sector, and the highest levels of officials and representatives of NGO, labour, business, aboriginal and youth organizations and associations. At such fora he/she negotiates and promotes major policy and program initiatives of multi-million dollar significance, which can have a national, provincial or regional impact. The incumbent frequently meets with ADMs and DMs of the central agencies and OGDs involved in the Branch s sphere of activity and is accountable for playing the lead role in developing a federal consensus for new human resources investment policy and program initiatives.

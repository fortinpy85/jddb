S Director. ITC, Moncton S Director, TC, Montreal S Director, ITC. Belleville 2 Director, !TC Winnipeg S Director, ITC, St-John's NATURE AND SCOPE The Department of Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) was created in 4993 from components of four major federal departments (i.e. CEIC, Labour Canada, Secretary of State and Health and Welfare Canada). It is a massive organization consisting of over 23 OOO employees with an operating budget of over $2.5 billion and a program budget of over $57 billion. It is the largest single expenditure department with over 38" of the total federal budget, and is responsible for 97% of the federal government 's transfers to individuals and 4O% of its transfers to the provinces. HRDC is widely decentralized and delivers its programs and services through II Regions including NCR) and over I,OOO service delivery points across Canada which include over 3OO major Human Resources Centres Canada, 2I tele-centres, IO Income Support Program mail-centres, a HQs and 6 Regional Information Technology Centres (ITCs). over 5,3OO self serve kiosks, as well as numerous service delivery arrangements with other levels of government and Alternative Service Delivery (ASD) providers. The Government of Canada has identified several priorities for HRDC most of which directly impact on the program and service delivery of the Systems Branch. These include: the need to develop electronic systems and products to disseminate labour market information so as to maximize the participation of all Canadians in the workplace; a fundamental reorientation of the national social security system and its delivery; innovation in programming and in partnership arrangements to significantly reduce HRDC s expenditures and contribute to deficit reduction, better value for tax- payers money in federal investments in departmental programming and service delivery. greater responsiveness to the interests of clients and stakeholders, and new fiscal and service delivery arrangements with the provinces and new ASD mechanisms. These priorities must be addressed during a time of increased social and economic pressures characterized by increasing and conflicting service delivery priorities and demands from clients and stakeholders. Canadian industries are also expecting the government to act as the leader in reorienting the Canadian labour market by enhancing educational! and training systems to produce the levels of skills and knowledge required to meet the expectations of the new job market, and to enhance their competitive advantage. Compounding the complexity of developing and overseeing the implementation of leading-edge IT systems, applications and support services. to enhance the department's response to these challenging national priorities and eapectations, is the requirement to drive these initiatives during a time of massive chief oft: snonsdft doc Last orinted I7/O7/2OO2 7:3O AM Page 2 of 8
federal resource reduction. The Systems Branch must renew the IT service orientation of the department. The department is known to possess a strong capacity to develop information-age systems, products and tools that contribute to its success in implementing massive legislative changes (e.g., the introduction of the Employment Insurance Act, changes to Canada Pension Plan) which have a tremendous impact on the department's service lines and clients. However, this has occurred at the expense of the general management of HRDC 's IT program which has lead to a certain lack of confidence in the overall orientation and performance of the national IT program and platforms. A result of this perception has been a proliferation of attempts by HRDC organizations to develop their own in-house IT capacity at the expense of an integrated, cohesive and standardized national IT system and program. Although major steps have been initiated over the last few years to help standardize departmental systems. processes, practices and service delivery, it recently became evident that a significant organizational change was required to strategically position the Systems Branch as the leading catalyst for HRDC's business process re-engineering initiatives and to better link departmental IT infrastructure with its business lines and service delivery requirements. A decision was therefore made to consolidate the Branch organization under three (3) Senior Director General, all responsible for delivering common denominator functions and services. This revitalized organization will strengthen the Branch capacity to efficiently respond to current and future challenges and improve its ability to: e Ensure the ongoing operational maintenance of HRDC critical systems. e Promote the development and implementation of an international caliber IT infrastructure capable to quickly adapt to ever increasing demands while at the same time guaranteeing secured information transactions at the most efficient cost possible. e Bring about the modifications and up-grades required to existing systems and/or develop and implement new systems in order to respond to new legislative demands and vetter support HRDC overall service delivery requirements to the Canadian pubkc. Within that context, the Chief, Information Technology Operations Officer (CITOO) is responsible for leading the development and implementation of long range plans and strategies as well as processes and procedures that will deliver HRDC business services at a competitive cost across Canada. He/she is called upon to focus on the consuiidation and rationalization of ITCs to enhance the cost effectiveness and the efficicricy of data processing and distribution.

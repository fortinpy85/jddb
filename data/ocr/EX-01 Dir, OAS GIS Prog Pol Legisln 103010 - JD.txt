In this context, the Director, OAS/GIS Policy and Legislation is accountable: the development of strategies, policies and programs to address change; legislative, regulatory, analytical and procedural expertise, and guidance to the various stakeholders and clients with respect to OAS/GIS program and policy matters; for leading the development and provision of support to the Policy and Coordination Division's analysis of societal and demographic changes impacting on OAS/GIS. With the establishment of the Department of Social Development, the renewed focus on policy development within the Branch, and the need to develop policy proposals in concert with the Canada Pension Plan Triennial Review cycle, the Director needs to ensure that the division is able to meet these responsibilities, as well as to position the division to provide broader economic, statistical research, qualitative and quantitative analysis and data presentation capabilities. The Director applies a strong program knowledge and skill in the direction and interpretation of the OAS/GIS, program objectives, policies, legislation and management within the context of Federal/Provincial/Territorial relations. In addition, the Director leads the development of reports and affidavits for OAS Charter appeals and in the provision of broader statistical research and analysis capabilities. The Director influences the directions of OAS/GIS policy research and development including policy analysis/options and research, in order to formulate authoritative legislation and regulatory advice to senior management and stakeholders. For example, reviews are being conducted to see if the GIS Options provisions can be simplified, whether the GIS Involuntary Separation provisions are compatible modern day care giving arrangements and to clarify operational policy on co-habitation in long term care facilities, and review of marital and common law evidentiary requirements in support of OAS/GIS/Allowance simplification initiatives to ensure that entitlements are adapted to society's new realities. The Director is responsible for leading and directing these review activities in collaboration with a number of internal and external partners. Working in concert with the Policy and Coordination Division and the Department of Finance, legislative changes are developed and policy directions are proposed and communicated. The Director has a major responsibility in ensuring the legislation reflects the social and economic needs of Canadians as well providing fairness and equity to future generations. The Director also plays a key role in preparing and supporting cabinet documents and providing detailed briefings concerning new legislation to senior government and parliamentary committees. A major aspect of the Director's position involves developing effective working relationships, agreements and MOU's with a variety of internal and external partners Orr OAS GIS Program Policy & Legislaton Final 9-O9-O4 Page 3 of 6
and stakeholders such as PWGSC, Revenue Canada, Finance, HRSD, the QPP/RRQ and other provincial/territorial government departments and agencies. These MOUs and agreements improve service delivery, assist in benefit take-up, reinforce integrity and simplify administration. The Director is also responsible for negotiating new data sharing and harmonization agreements with the provinces. Increased harmonization, information sharing, and new technologies will provide new operational and delivery opportunities, reduce duplication, and streamline operations. Improved information sharing will also identify recipients of benefits under other plans and jurisdictions and lead to the reduction of stacking benefits and the reduction of costs. In addition to working with a variety of internal and external partners and stakeholders, the Director is responsible for developing effective communication and consultation strategies with individuals and interest groups across Canada. This involvement and participation is critical to developing effective changes as well as gaining support. The Director is responsible for combining all these inputs into defining and reshaping the OAS/GIS Program and the supporting policy, program and delivery frameworks. This involves not only working with a variety of groups but also analyzing the present program, the administrative and policy frameworks, delivery options, alternate service delivery options and the opportunities provided by new technologies and developing a program that meets present and future requirements while balancing and linking operational and policy priorities. The Director provides advice to the Minister, the Deputy and the ADM on OAS/GIS issues. The present economic and political climate and current government initiatives to focus on seniors issues and reform social policy have increased Canadian awareness and focused greater attention on the CPP/OAS programs and social policy reform. Other human rights issues such as new definitions of the family or of a spouse have significant impact on social policy and programs and the Director must provide the Minister with the appropriate information to respond to these kinds of issues when raised in the House of Commons, the media or by constituents. The Director provides guidance and expertise in the development of new or revised legislation relating to the OAS/GIS Program that provides fairness and equity to present and future generations of Canadians. This also involves understanding the latest social, economic and work trends and their impact on the OAS/GIS and incorporating them in related program development The Director balances all the various interests and concerns when developing effective work-sharing and partnership strategies with a variety of partners and stakeholders. These strategies are complex and involve different levels of government, different departments, and the private sector and result in different objectives such as legislation development, alternate service delivery and information sharing. In addition to revising legislation directly related to the OAS/GIS program, these information sharing partnerships require the development of Privacy Impact Assessments, have Systems implications and can have an impact on MOUs with other departments as well on Dir OAS GIS Program Policy & Legislation Final 9-O9-O4 Page 4 of 6
service delivery. These partnerships are extremely complex, dynamic, involve partners with different priorities and agendas and yet they are critical to the reshaping and delivery of the OAS/GIS program. Change is constant today and the OAS/GIS must have the capacity to adapt without undergoing major overhauls on a continual basis. Major trends in government focus on reducing costs, streamlining activities and processes and developing innovative way of delivering services. The Director must assess these alternate service delivery trends and business practices and build-in a capacity for adopting change within the legislation and the Program. This involves looking ahead several years and anticipating the use of new technologies to deliver services, new partnerships with federal and provincial governments to eliminate duplication, increased de-centralization and integrated service delivery options. This is of particular importance in supporting the Department's Modernizing Service for Canadians (MSC) initiatives.

Service Canada, as the national service delivery arm of ESDC, helps Canadians access government services and benefits by providing seamless, comprehensive one-stop service, advice, guidance and assistance to Canadians, delivered in a way that meets program objectives, and ensure a positive service experience for Canadians. Service Canada represents the primary face of the Government of Canada in meeting the everyday requirements of its Citizens. This service delivery approach simplifies government and increases the accessibility and ease with which anyone needing Government of Canada information and services can successfully obtain what they need when they need it. Service delivery is based on four fundamental principles: access for all Canadians, an interactive relationship with citizens and communities, demonstrable service excellence, and sustainable federal presence. There are four Regional Branches, which are each responsible for program and business delivery throughout Canada. The delivery of programs within a regional context allows each region to develop particular expertise based on their proximity to the service recipient / client. This allows them to be adeptly equipped to provide integration of regional realities into the operationalization of program policies and direction; leading pilots for national initiatives thus ensuring objectives align with the end results and delivery. The regional programs are managed in a complex framework that provides federal services within an integrated, distributed governance model supporting federal and departmental policy and program development. These regional programs provide, in addition to the pre-existing ESDC programs, client services and advice of other federal departments and agencies such as access to passport services.

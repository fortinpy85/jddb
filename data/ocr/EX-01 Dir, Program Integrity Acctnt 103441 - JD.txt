NATURE AND SCOPE The Learning Branch was formed due to the significant emphasis placed on learning and investment in Learning for the future in the 2OO4 Speech from the Throne and 2OO4 and 2OO5 Budgets. It Is responsible for: a wide range of programs (including Canada Student [Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program, Adult Learning and Literacy Programs), changes to programs in the short and the medium-term to support lifelong leaming and literacy: negotiating. implementing and ensuring the ongoing enhancement of new service provision arrangements: implementing strong corporate governance frameworks and control over both its Grants and Contributions and Statutory programs: establishing and sustaining proactive consultation. knowledge and information networks and processes with domestic. foreign and international partners and stakeholders: and providing strategic advice and briefings to the ADM, DM and Mimsters. The CLSP dates back to I964, Three major loan regimes marked its development: from I964 to I994, it was a statutory program, under the Canada Students Loans Act. offering guaranteed loans; in I994, the Canada Students Financial Assistance Act was enacted and risk-shared loans replaced guaranteed loans: and since 2OOO, it has provided direct loans in collaboration with the provinces and territories. This evolution has created a formidable challenge in the management of loans that have been granted under three different regimes, two different Acts and have been administrated by banks or federal- provincial territorial organisations. Retracing the history of any given file is an arduous and complex endeavour. The CSLP Is. a vital component of the Government's Skills and Learning Agenda to enable Canadians to learn, acquire skills and participate fully in the civic, social and economne life of the 2I ! century. The Program mandate is enacted in legislation and Cabinet-approved program policy. Its mission Is to promote accessibility to post-secondary education (PSE) for qualified students through the provision of regular part-time loans to lessen their financial hardship, and to ensure Canadians have an opportunity to develop the skills to fully participate in a know ledge-based cconomy and society. The CSLP Directorate is responsible for the governance of the Program, planning, organizing and allocating available human, financial and material resources to realize the strategic objectives, goals and pnorities of the Program within the objectives and broader context of the Branch, HRSDC and the federal government. The Directorate is a mayor component of the I_earming Branch, covering a wide range of program areas that have a direct impact on students enrolled in universities. colleges. in vocational schools and other related programs. on HRSDC finance. and on the life of younger and increasingly adult Canadians.

Orrecter, Program Integnty and Accountabitity, CSLP Page 3 Of 6 Given the expansion of the CSLP, its significantly increased complexity and its importance within government and high profile with Canadians and the media, a business model for the division of accountabilities and responsibilities between the DG and the Senior Director was designed based on an analysis of best practices and lessons learned in the public service in managing complex programs which require decision-making in multiple and diverse areas of expertise, and where the addition of individual talents working collaboratively contribute to effective and consistent corporate leadership. [n this business model, the Senior Director has delegated responsibility for the day-to-day intemal management of the Directorate and its program Divisions for all service delivery issues and activities, including coordinating all Directorate horizontal business processes (including business resource planning: performance measurement, risk assessment: service delivery and resource, operational policy and research, monitoring. evaluation and reporting: Ministerial Correspondence; Internal Communications: and CSL System operations and maintenance), facihtating process enhancement and reengineering. and managing change. Within this context, the Director is responsible for the design, development, implementation and management of integrated strategic and business planning. accountability and reporting frameworks, processes and reports that enhance the CSLP Directorate s collective capacity to make sound business decisions, and effectively manage the program and the resources required to achieve strategic objectives and operational goals. Working in consultation and collaboration with PPPI), the incumbent is responsible for the development and management of the Directorate s orgamzational accountability framework, including execution of the performance management plan, the evaluation plan. the risk management and audit plan, the portfolio management plan, the operational reporting plan and statutory reporting plan, within the context of the broader accountability and reporting requirements of the Branch. Through professional leadership and expertise, the Director performs a entical liaison and integration function across the Directorate and externally. The Director provides performance-oriented functions and corporate support for the CSLP through a mux of policy and project work. The incumbent directs the haison with PPPD to enhance the capacity to provide effective stewardship for the resources that have been allocated to the program. The incumbent is responsible for developing approaches, processes and methodologies to monitor. analyze and report on the CSLP s success in achieving its strategic and business results, and for monitoring and analyzing the program performance of the loan portfolio, the Directorate and the Service Providers against strategic, business and operational plans. In consultation and close collaboration with PPPD, the Director provides professional leadership in advancing the development of integrated performance, financial and non-financial information frameworks, approaches and processes that combine the most critical data and advice to support results- based decision-making and reporting. The incumbent must lead the ongoing development of a comprehensive risk management framework that Is consistent with the strategic and business planning processes of the Branch, and integrated into all CSLP planning and decision-making processes. Once the risk management model is fully integrated into the planning framework of the program, the challenge hes in bringing it further into the performance model, measuring risk to the program through key measures and indicators, and working to improve performance in collaboration with the provinces and Service Providers. Decisions taken today may not have their full impact on the portfolio for IO-I5 years, and therefore the Director must work to improve management of the portfolio through the utilization of sophisticated forecasting models and analysis The Director promotes rigorous program governance and stewardship that includes the responsibility to safeguard public assets, the effective management of the Department s student loan portfolio, and the development, operation and support of key forward planning, reporting and contro! processes and systems tor the CSLP. These include management processes, standards and measures of success, as well as improved accountability that involves closer links to the Service Providers and stakeholder communities.

A major challenge Is the responsibility for the improved accountability for the CSLP loan portfolio, which is growing and now directly funded. A significant vulnerability for the program hes in the area of portfolio performance. Currently, the federal government has approximately $3.5 billion in loans in repayment. Depending on the value of loans going out and the number of loans consolidating in any given year, the portfolio in repayment should increase by $I billion or more a year. In partnership with the provinces and Service Providers, the Director focuses efforts on improving portfolio integrity and performance: sharing information and lessons learned, analyzing trends, moving into m-depth, technical portfolio analysts, discussing options, designing and testing pilot projects and borrower risk profiling approaches, introducing and implementing new performance indicators and other changes, and enhancing communication strategies with borrowers through collaboration with other intemal/external organizations. There are a number of ongoing projects at any given time in this sophisticated and specialized area of endeavour. Projects may be bi- or mulu-lateral, involving anything that touches on integrity or portfolio performance issues, such as enhanced data matching, integrated collections, special audits, tuition retunds, accountability frameworks and performance agreements contained in integration agreements with the provinces. The Director collaborates in the process to develop CSLP s strategic and business goals, plans and priorities, and the identification and allocation of the financial, human and materiel resources. The incumbent ts also responsible for the development, monitoring. analysis and reporting of an accountability framework in response to Branch strategic planning, used to establish the general direction of the CSLP, develop subsequent operational and work plans, measure performance, and make effective resource allocation decisions relating to performance monitoring and statutory reporting. The Director reports on the progress of CSIP programs, portfolio and initiatives within the context of the Branch and Departmental planning framework and associated key management strategies. The Director leads the promotion and facilitation across the Directorate of the rigorous stewardship of program resources including program integrity, the responsibility to safeguard public assets. and the development, operation and support of key control systems, management processes, standards and measures of success. The incumbent must ensure that risk and accountability trameworks incorporate the requirements of new Service Providers who carry out many of the administrative tasks associated with loan payment and repayment, once the provinces territorics have approved loan applications from students. Ensuring the proper stewardship of portfolio assets and monitoring of the Service Providers and program management for both old and new loans requires robust and responsive approaches and processes. The incumbent ts responsible for having the proper operational methodologies in place to prepare review, audit and evaluation plans, and directs both intemal and external teams to assure professional competence in undertaking such monitoring. Reconciling the needs and expectations of program managers, Service Providers and other stakeholders in managing a portfolio composed of both old and new loans, is challenging. The Director is called upon to develop strategies that will advance the capacity of the Directorate to effectively utilize risk assessment, performance and service standards and measurement in managing the CSLP. The Director Is expected to work closely with other Divisions in CSLP to maximize knowledge and innovation, and incorporate best practices of client-centric decision-making. In consultation with PPPD, the Director represents the Directorate in discussions with senior departmental officials, and with seruor officials of central agencies (such as Finance, Treasury Board Secretariat) to discuss issues affecting program integrity, accountability, evaluation, audit, and performance and reporting issues of the CSLP.

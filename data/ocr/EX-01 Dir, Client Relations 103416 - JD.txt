NATURE AND SCOPE The new Learning Branch was formed due to the significant emphasis placed on learning and investment in Learning for the future in the 2OO4 Speech from the Throne and 2OO4 and 2OO5 Budgets. It Is responsible for: a wide range of programs (including Canada Student Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program, Adult Learning and Literacy Programs); changes to programs in the short and the medium-term to support lifelong learning and literacy, negotiating, implementing and ensuring the ongoing enhancement of new service provision arrangements: implementing strong corporate governance frameworks and control over both its Grants and Contributions and Statutory programs. establishing and sustaining proactive consultation, knowledge and information networks and processes with domestic, foreign and international partners and stakeholders; and providing strategic advice and briefings to the ADM, DM and Ministers. The CLSP dates back to I964. Three major loan regimes marked its development: from I964 to I994, it was a statutory program. under the Canada Students Loans Act, offering guaranteed loans: in I994, the Canada Students Financial Assistance Act was enacted and risk-shared loans replaced guaranteed loans: and since 2OOO. it has provided direct loans in collaboration with the provinces and territories. This evolution has created a formidable challenge in the management of loans that have been granted under three different regimes, two different Acts and have been administrated by banks or federal- provincial/territorial organisations. Retracing the history of any given file is an arduous and complex endeavour. The CSLP is a vital component of the Government's Skills and Learning Agenda to enable Canadians to learn, acquire skills and participate fully in the civic, social and economic life of the 2I century. The Program mandate is enacted in legislation and Cabinet-approved program policy. Its mission Is to promote accessibility to post-secondary education (PSE) for qualified students through the provision of regular/part-time loans to lessen their financial hardship, and to ensure Canadians have an opportunity to develop the skills to fully participate in a knowledge-based economy and society. The CSLP Directorate is responsible for the governance of the Program, planning. organizing and allocating available human, financial and material resources to realize the strategic objectives, goals and priorities of the Program within the objectives and broader context of the Branch, HRSDC and the federal government. The Directorate is a major component of the Learning Branch, covering a wide range of program areas that have a direct impact on students enrolled in universities, colleges, in vocational schools and other related programs, on HRSDC finance, and on the life of younger and increasingly adult Canadians.

Employment and Social Development Canada The DSLU, as part of the Department of Justice, is committed to achieving the objectives and goals of the DOJ Process Optimization strategy to manage the demand for and cost of legal services delivery through increased efficiencies. The establishment of the Dispute Resolution Office is intended to support the cost effective management and resolution of Departmental litigation by utilizing all available settlement options outside of the formal legal process and support the continuum of ESD s dispute management initiatives related to litigation. Part of the DOJ Process Optimization strategy and early settlement mandate is to manage the legal risk that may arise, from policy development to program implementation and service delivery and, of course, from litigation. Consequently, the management of legal risk is a joint responsibility between DOJ and the client department. In supporting clients with high quality legal services, DOJ continues to work to ensure the institutionalization of a culture of legal risk management across the federal government. Some of the key activities to identify, avoid, mitigate or manage Jegal risk early in the litigation cycle include exploring ways to reduce legal risks through instrument choice; exploring alternatives to litigation where disputes arise; contingency planning for high impact litigation cases; and client training to raise awareness of legal risks and in identifying potential mitigation strategies. Risk levels have a major impact on workloads and the amount of flexibility the OSLU has in managing egal files.

ESDC has undertaken a number of Business Transformation and Modernization initiatives to meet the expectations of Canadians for the delivery of high-quality services that are timely, secure and accessible. These initiatives include improvements to service delivery and the increased use of technolagy to provide more online services and to increase operational efficiency while respecting the privacy of Canadians; building a modern workplace that leverages technology to enhance departmental planning and performance; and developing efficiencies by streamlining and standardizing core business functions and internal processes and undertaking required enabling projects.

The Dispute Resolution Office works in partnership with [CMP and HR Branch in a complementary fashion, to assist in getting to disputes earlier in the process, to avoid escalation to more formal avenues involving litigation, including PSST, PSRLB and CHRC. Within this context, the Director, Dispute Resolution Services is responsible for providing professional leadership and management direction within the Unit's matrix management environment, for the development, implementation and administration of cost-effective service delivery approaches, processes and tools for the discussion, review and resolution of complex, potentially high dollar-value disputes involving the ESDC, its partners and clients engaged in litigation through the development and management of a comprehensive litigation based dispute resolution process.

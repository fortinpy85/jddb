NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS The Department of Employment and Social Development (ESDC) Act states that ESDC is a continuation of the former Department of Human Resources and Skills Development and that the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of ESDC under Article 5(I) of the Act extend to and include all matters relating to human resources and skills development in Canada or the social development of Canada over which Parliament has jurisdiction and which are not by law assigned to any other Minister, department, board or agency of the Government of Canada. . And under article 5(2) is noted The Minister shall exercise the powers and perform the duties and functions (a) relating to human resources and skills development with a view to improving the standard of living and quality of life of all Canadians by promoting a highly skilled and mobile workforce and an efficient and inclusive labour market;. . . The 2OI5 Speech from the Throne emphasized the importance of renewing a nation-to-nation relationship between Canada and Indigenous communities, based on rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. In this context the Government has made significant commitments to improve the socio-economic conditions of Indigenous peoples and their communities for a better future and quality of life. A key component of this effort includes ensuring that Indigenous children have a real and fair chance to succeed. Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) services are critical to providing children with a solid foundation for future success. This is especially true for Indigenous children, whose access to culturally appropriate, high quality, flexible and affordable ELCC empowers them with a strong sense of Page 2 of 8
EY Emploi et D veloppement Employment and : social Canada Social Development Canada identity and establishes a foundation for their health, wellness and future success. Enriching ELCC programs and services can also holistically support parents and families to participate in their communities, cultures and languages. At the direction of the Prime Minister, the overarching goal of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development is to increase Canadian s economic and social security. Achieving this goal includes advancing work on a number of top priorities including working with Indigenous peoples to develop and implement a National Early Learning and Childcare Framework as a first step toward delivering affordable, high quality, flexible and fully inclusive childcare. In June 2OI7 federal-provincial-territorial Ministers responsible for ELCC announced an agreement on a Multilateral ELCC Framework to make enhancements to provincial and territorial ELCC systems that will improve the lives of Canadian children and their families with consideration for families more in need including Indigenous families. The federal role in ELCC is largely limited to the transfer of funding to provinces and territories to support their ELCC programs and tax measures and transfers to individuals and families to offset some of their child-care costs. Indigenous ELCC is an exception to this approach...In 2OI8, the federal government delivered the following Indigenous ELCC programs which served to address gaps in provincial and territorial services (including early learning and child care on reserve and in high need areas): a) First Nations and Inuit Child Care Initiative (FNICCI) administered by Employment and Social Development (ESDC); b) Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve (AHSOR) administered by Indigenous Services Canada (ISC); and c) Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern Communities, (AHSUNC) administered by Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).The budget of these three programs was $I32 million a year. These programs were criticized as a patchwork, and unresponsive to the needs of Indigenous peoples. The government launched an engagement process in collaboration with organizations representing Indigenous peoples and on the bases of the feedback co-developed the Indigenous ELCC Framework with National Indigenous Organizations. Cabinet accepted the Framework as a guide for its future policies and released the Framework in cooperation with the AFN, MNC and ITK. At the same time the Government announced the IELCC Transformative Initiative with a budget of $I.7 billion over IO years. This Initiative is a new model of Indigenous programming that feature distinction based partnerships and collaborative decision-making. In April 2OI8, the Government approved the Indigenous Early Learning and Childcare Transformation Initiative which gave the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development authority: to finalize and publicly release the Indigenous ELCC Framework; to establish a distinctions-based approach to IELCC implementation with the creation of three funding envelopes; to expand federal support to the Metis and to all Indigenous peoples regardless of where they live in Canada; to support greater self determination by transferring IELCC programs to Indigenous control; and to recognize the Framework as a new cornerstone for shared action on Indigenous ELCC. As an interim step, before transfer, direction was given to evolve federal programs to allow more flexible federal program terms and conditions required for cohesive child-care and early learning services under Indigenous control.. This approach to ILECC will serve as an example of a new policy approach for federal administration of programs with and for Canada s Indigenous people. The main elements of this new approach include: the creation of jointly managed funds for the First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nation; the creation of National and regional Partnership Tables of Indigenous and Federal government representatives to take decisions on policy, programming, priorities, funding allocations and service delivery; targeted support for the development of governance capacity: the authority to integrate current federal programs into one IELCC program; and the authority to transfer all policy and programming responsibilities for IELCC to regional Indigenous governance organizations. This is a transformative initiative for which there is no established guide or blueprint.. It is also complex in that the specifics of programs, partnerships and authorities will vary by distinction group (First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nation) and by province and territory. The decision to include Metis, in addition to First Nations and Inuit, as eligible beneficiaries for ELCC funding and to work in partnership with the Metis Nation governments and organizations is precedent setting and requires the development of new federal policies, program guidelines and financial and accountability instruments. To support the successful implementation of the IELCC Framework and this new policy approach for the federal administration of Indigenous programming, Ministers agreed that a federal Secretariat needed to be created, under the auspices of ESDC, that would serve as a focal point for the Federal Government for the coordination and implementation of this whole of government approach. To this end, the Indigenous Early Learning Child Care Secretariat has been created , with a mandate to co-ordinate and integrate IELCC programs in ISC (AHSOR), PHAC (AHSUNC) and ESDC (FNICCI) and to develop the inter-departmental authorities, financial policies and procedures to manage these as an integrated whole in collaboration with Indigenous leadership. Positioned under ESDC s Senior Assistant Deputy Minister Strategic and Service Policy Branch, and Chief Results Page 3 of 8
EY Emploi et D veloppement Employment and : social Canada Social Development Canada and Delivery Officer,, the position of Director General, IELCC Secretariat is being created to be the federal focal point for the federal Indigenous ELCC policy and programming and to lead the integration and eventual transfer of all federal IELCC programming to Indigenous control. The Indigenous Early Learning Child Care Secretariat is responsible for providing the leadership federally, to work with Indigenous governments and organizations and with provinces and territories to improve access to high quality, affordable, flexible and culturally-based services for First Nation, Inuit, and M tis children and families that address the distinct needs of First Nations on reserves and off reserves, the distinct needs of the M tis Nation communities, and the distinct needs of the Inuit. This is to be done in a manner that supports reconciliation between Canada and its Indigenous peoples. The IELCC Transformation Initiative will support the design, delivery and governance of IELCC services by the First Nations on and off the reserves for their people, the M tis Nation for its people, and the Inuit for its people. . The Director, Strategic Policy and Partnership, with the guidance of the Director General, IELCC Secretariat, is responsible for the following: - leading the development of Cabinet and Treasury Board products (e.g. IELCC call-backs, support to F-P/T bilateral mandates;, liaising with the ELCC Division to develop federal-territorial-provincial strategies in support of Indigenous and Multi-lateral ELCC Frameworks; providing advice, documents and briefings to support to broader Indigenous governance fora (e.g. Permanent Bilateral Mechanisms, DM bilateral meetings with National Indigenous Organizations, DM Committees relating to Indigenous Issues); and to manage IELCC governance fora (e.g. ADM and DG Committees) to advance the development of mutually acceptable governance concepts, policies and procedures that can support the transformation initiative. - leading the co-development of the IELCC Transformation Initiative s data collection, results assessment and evaluation strategies with First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nations, and implementing it with the M tis Nation: - leading the development of the terms and conditions for Transfer of IELCC to regional Indigenous governance and negotiating this with Indigenous leadership; and negotiating these agreements with Metis Nation regional governance organizations. - leading the implementation of the IELCC Transformation Initiative with M tis Nation, including: leading the negotiations with M tis Nation nationally and regionally to establish and maintain effective Partnership Tables that take policy, programming and funding allocation decisions on IELCC; representing Canada at these forums; and directly negotiating and managing some Contribution Agreements and providing direction to Programs Operations Branch, Service Canada, Indigenous Services Canada and Public Health Agency Canada to negotiate and mange Contribution Agreements to affect the decisions of these Partnership Tables. - leading, directly or through subordinate executives, the taking of the IELCC Transformation Framework consultation contacts and partnerships developed in that phase of this transition, and using them and new relationships with representatives of other federal departments, provincial and territorial governments and First Nation, Inuit, and Metis Nation people and organizations in critical change management partnerships to achieve the objectives of the IELCC Transformative Initiative. - providing strategic and tactical advice on policy options for making progress in obtaining acceptable common federal positions for the policies required for the implementation of the IELCC transformation initiative; achieving a common understanding and acceptance by First Nation, Inuit, and M tis Nation governments and communities, of the risks, responsibilities, and training required for them to assume their responsibilities under a Transfer agreement;,- providing strategic and tactical advice to federal senior management on the approach to supporting greater authority and responsibility for ELCC by Indigenous governments; - providing advice to the senior management of ESDC including the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development who has been given the authority to implement this Transformation Initiative, and to the senior management of, Indigenous Services Canada (ISC), the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and any other federal departments involved with IELCC, on the status of the Initiative, the results achieved, and challenges to be faced in the implementation of the federal horizontal IELCC Transformation Initiative. The position requires considerable in-depth knowledge of Indigenous peoples in Canada, policy formulation and Page 4of 8

In particular, the position requires a specialist's knowledge of the following: - The structure and processes for strong, effective and accountable governance of social programs with emphasis on Indigenous models of governance ; - The methodologies and practices of policy analyses and program design and development in the governments in Canada; - The machinery of government, the roles and relationships of central agencies (Privy Council Office, Treasury Board Secretariat, Office of the Comptroller General, Department of Finance) to government departments and the process and timing of the policy and financial decision making within the Government of Canada. - The legal accountability framework of the Government of Canada including the laws (Financial Administration Act, Accountability Act), regulations and directives that underpin the management of programs and the expenditure of federal moneys. Specific knowledge of the Treasury Board Directive on Transfer Payments and the structure of Contribution Agreements is important; - Early Learning and Child Care programs design, content, organization, evaluation and delivery particularly in the context of Indigenous peoples; - Canadian Indigenous peoples; their organization, history, cultures, languages, and political structures: - Current issues, agreements and reports that affect the Government of Canada's relationship with Indigenous peoples including Constitutional provisions, Supreme Court decisions, treaties, accords, policy statements (Principles Respecting the Government of Canada s Relationship With Indigenous Peoples), commission reports (Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission), international agreements (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) and reports of Indigenous governments or organizations; - Statistical theory and its application to populations and social program design, administration, analyses and evaluation including an understanding of the source and content of statistical reports and surveys that are most important to Indigenous ELCC in Canada: - The history of the federal government's involvement in Indigenous ELCC and the design, administration and delivery of federal IELCC programs (First Nations and Inuit Child Care, Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve and Aboriginal Head Start Urban and Northern Communities); - Methodology and application of programs of audits, evaluation, quality assessment and outcome measurement for ELCC programs; and - Negotiations with Indigenous peoples. The Director, Strategic Policy and Partnership, requires a significant level of experience in a managerial capacity with the federal or provincial/territorial governments with responsibilities in the following areas: - Directing a complex program with the involvement of a number of parties and many stakeholders, a significant budget and heightened political sensitivities; - Working with Indigenous peoples, governments and organizations in a financial or program policy capacity; - Preparation of memorandum to Cabinet and/or Treasury Board submissions; - Preparation of briefing material and giving oral briefings to Assistant Deputy Ministers, Deputy Ministers and/or Ministers or Ministers staff; - Supervising statistical data analyses on the social needs of populations and/or the impact of programs and services; - Conducting negotiations with federal or provincial departments or National Organizations with respect to a program, service or financial arrangements; - Program or policy analyses particularly for a central agency of government; - Making presentations to committees on complex and controversial issues or proposals; and - Supervision of staff and management of an operational and transfer payment budget. The Director, Strategic Policy and partnership, must address find solutions to at least four challenges. I. Developing the policies, program guidelines, financial guidelines, procedures and operations framework that are required to establish this new model of federal Indigenous programming. This model requires collaborative decision making between the federal government and respectively the First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nation at the national and regional level. Agreement on authorities and accountabilities will have to be negotiated with federal departments. Agreements are needed on program policies and priorities, roles and responsibilities, financial allocations to programs and communities, accountabilities, reporting and performance measurement such as to Page 5 of 8
EY Emploi et D veloppement Employment and : social Canada Social Development Canada enhance the quality and availability of Indigenous ELCC. A major part of this work is the development of a results framework that could be endorsed by Indigenous leadership and the government. This will require exceptional policy modelling, challenging negotiations and complex operationalizing in a multi-party environment. 2. Operationalizing a new program relationship between the Metis Nation and the federal government in an area in which the Metis were traditionally not eligible. This will require staring from scratch to put in place the governance, administration and program delivery organization and procedures were nothing existed before. Federal help will be required to build the national and regional partnership relations and infrastructure. In addition to the administrative challenges, there are significant political challenges in working out acceptable operation arrangements. 3. Putting in place the Transfer of IELCC to regional Indigenous organization option, by developing the policy, negotiating it with Indigenous leadership and getting it agreed to by the federal government (Cabinet and Treasury Board) is a major piece of work. This is a type of self-government agreement that is based on partnerships between Indigenous governments and with federal and perhaps provincial/territorial governments. It will require new financial agreements and a new accountability framework. It involves legal, financial, administrative and political challenges. 4. Integrating the Indigenous ELCC policies, programming and service delivery with the broader provincially led ELCC agenda while preserving and enhancing the engagement and control of Indigenous leadership over services for their people. At the macro political level this requires the development of a policy framework in which ELCC policy is inclusive of Indigenous peoples but recognises their different governance an operational realities. At the national level this is similar to the accommodation given to Quebec. At the operational level, this would facilitate an integration of ELCC services for Indigenous children with heightened Indigenous control. The Director, Strategic Policy and Partnership represents the federal government's IELCC Secretariat established within ESDC to coordinate federal government efforts with regard to IELCC programming and to engage Indigenous partners through the establishment and maintenance of national and regional partnership tables for the creation, implementation, and advancing objectives of the IELCC Transformation Initiative. As such the Director represents the Director General IELCC Secretariat, and the Department of Economic and Social Development in meetings with other federal departments as a focal point for the Initiative and one of the three lead federal executives charged with advancing the main objectives of the Initiative and the results the federal government has committed to achieve. The Director represents the Director General, the ADM and the federal government directly or through subordinate staff in consultations and negotiations with provincial and territorial governments and with Indigenous organizations in national and regional partnership tables. The Director will be the lead for the IELCC Transformation Initiative to put in place the transfer of IELCC programming and funding designed to meet the culturally distinct based requirements of the First Nations, the Inuit, the M tis Nation peoples to Indigenous control, that can serve as a corner- stone for other programs. It would proceed at a pace and process of their choosing and demonstrate a clear example of reconciliation between Canada and Indigenous peoples. The Director is a member of the IELCC Secretariat management committee, and Director will represent the Director General IELCC Secretariat as an alternate member of the Branch Management Committee. The Director will serve as an alternate to the Director General as required, on other key DG-level committees within the department, and will play a key role in contributing to the overall effectiveness and management of the Secretariat, of the Branch, and of the Department. The Director will play a key role in the decision-making process regarding the federal horizontal policy on IELCC, and on the current and future strategic and operational direction of that policy.

Manager, Occupational Research e Since the I96O s, HRSDC (and its predecessors) have had the authority to develop and distribute occupational classification systems that support Government of Canada policies and programs. The NOC is the current authoritative framework used to describe and classify occupations found throughout the Canadian labour market. The NOC provides the foundation for the collection and interpretation of occupational data obtained through the Census of the Population, the Labour Force Survey and many other public and private sector research initiatives. The NOC and its accompanying products provide the basis for a common understanding of work, skills, entry requirements and other employment related factors for successful labour market integration and mobility of Canadians and immigrants. The essence of the Unit s core activities include ongoing research and analysis of occupational changes that occur in the Canadian labour market and disseminating these changes in NOC releases aligned with Census cycles.

The completion of the next major NOC revision is planned for March 2OII. While preliminary work for this project started in fiscal year 2OO8/O9, research and analysis activities will intensify starting early on in fiscal year 2OO9 and continue until 2OII in time for Census 2OII. NATURE AND SCOPE: The mission of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive workforce, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians.

t ] The LMI Directorate is responsible for overseeing the program policy, design, analysis, assessment and delivery of the Foreign Credential Recognition (FCR) Program to enhance the achievement of positive labour market outcomes for foreign trained individuals in targeted occupations and sectors; ensuring that foreign-trained workers have access to improved labour market information to help them make informed decisions about immigrating to and working in Canada via the Going to Canada Portal ; supporting the Foreign Credential Referral Office (FCRO) at Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC); leading federal implementation of Chapter 7 (Labour Mobility) of the Agreement on Internal Trade; directing the design, development, assessment and Ongoing enhancements of labour market information tools and products to inform Canadians with respect to occupational/career opportunities; and Providing functional direction, advice and guidance to Service Canada labour market information services, Within this context the Director is responsible for ensuring that the array of traditional labour market, human resources development, occupational and career development information products and services continue to respond to the demands of the Canadian labour market. The labour Market, more so than most other markets, is subject to complex imperfections and other constraints. A lack of or imperfect information is a constraint to the adjustment of labour market supply and demand and constitutes an impediment to labour market mobility. It also makes it increasingly difficult for workers to decide which type of education, training or skills development to undertake or whether and when to make a geographic or occupational move. In this role of providing leadership and management, the Director must ensure the continued integrity of labour market data, systems and procedures while ensuring the successful implementation of changes arising out of increased demand by users and partners in an increasingly turbulent labour market environment. The Director works collaboratively with Service Canada to fulfil the terms of the LMI Annex to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Service Canada and HRSDC which includes overseeing the development of performance indicators for the LMI function and the provision of foundational tools such as the NOC. The Director ensures that the development of tools and new approaches will enhance the national understanding, practice and/or acquisition of essential and other workplace skill sets by key players in the workplace and workforce (i.e., employers, sector councils). The Director plays a pivotal role in promoting a profound cultural change to encourage innovative, demand-driven thinking and ways to better integrate Labour Market Information Programming and service delivery with Workplace Skills, to create a common foundation for the development of national products and tools. To this end, the Director leads and manages the Essential Skills Research Project (ESRP) aimed at developing essentiai skills profiles for all national occupational groups that are representative of Canada as a whole. This involves extensive consultations with employees to ensure the accuracy of the skills identified, as well as numerous meetings with national associations to validate the skills profiles developed by the SLMI Division.

The Director plays a key, strategic horizontal management role using the national products and tools as a basis for furthering the federal labour market and social development agenda. Within the department, the Director leads the development of strategic alliances, partnerships and new working arrangements to Promote the integration of the NPTs into HRSDC Programming (e.g., Aboriginal, Youth, Employment, and Learning), and externally with other federal departments (e.g., Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), CIC) and external program Partners such as the provinces and territories, Sector Councils, colleges, and other non-government organizations. As the leader in SLMI matters, the Director provides expert, authoritative advice and briefing materials to departmental senior Management, the Minister and other HRSDC senior officials on related initiatives, and provides expert support for their appearances before Cabinet and Parliamentary Committees. The Director is responsible for the effective Management of the work unit, including the management of human, financial and materiel resources and for the unit's priority-setting process in support of executive decision-making and resource allocation. The Director must also establish performance measurement criteria in order to provide a focal point for the work unit's overall planning activities such that program and policy directions can be integrated and monitored against official goals and objectives, thus allowing the unit to measure the attainment of its work objectives. Key challenges for this role include: ensuring government objectives are met while maintaining collaboration, engagement and agreement among partners and stakeholders with different priorities, accountabilities and resources; managing workload and integration of initiatives in an area which has recently experienced significant organizational change and continues to face a possible realignment between HRSDC and Service Canada; continued human resources challenges which are limiting the ability to undertake the primary task of developing profiles to cover the main occupations of the Canadian labour market, and renew/update required methodological work; a lack of clear accountabilities and conflicting priorities related to the LMI function across HRSDC/Service Canada; unknown impacts of newly negotiated Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDA) and Labour Market Agreements (LMA) in relation to data availability, creation and dissemination of LMI, and maintaining a consistent Canadian LMI Function; a continuing requirement to provide leadership and guidance to the HRSDC regional components and to coordinate on a national scale what was traditionally done on a regional scale; lack of awareness of the need for LMI to be adequately prioritized and resourced in order to be able to do meet the known needs and demands of internal and external clients and partners. Another key challenge is to provide leadership in the development of new products and services, based on input from a wide range of stakeholders and partners (e.g., Sector Councils, provincia! and _ territorial governments, non-government organizations, unions, academic institutions and community groups). The Director leads the revitalization of workplace skills products, and enables the Directorate to Draft March 2 2OO9 version Page 5

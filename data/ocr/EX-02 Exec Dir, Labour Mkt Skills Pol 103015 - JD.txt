The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors.

Pre-pandemic mega-trends impacting the labour market and skills development such as population aging and a transition toward a carbon-low economy are still present, while some others (automation, digitalization) have been accelerated by the pandemic. These trends also permanently changed consumer behaviours and forced organizations to revise their business models, which has already started to impact skills sought by these organizations as well as occupation in labour shortages and surplus.

NATURE AND SCOPE Departmental Context The mission of Employment and Skills Development Canada (ESDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished by developing policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning and to work in their communities. ESDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life's transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. As both a policy, program and service delivery centre, ESDC is accountable for the development and implementation of policies, strategies, frameworks and initiatives that integrate and harmonize the mandates of the three organizational entities at the corporate level. This corporate leadership and coordination role ensures that the Ministers, Secretary of State, Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are provided with considered and consistent advice that represents the collective views of ESDC, Labour Program and Service Canada. The Minister of ESDC is supported by one Deputy Minister and an Associate Deputy Minister for ESDC, and a Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada. The Minister of Labour is supported by a Deputy Minister of Labour, who relies on the resources of ESDC. The Labour Program promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment and Service Canada is the delivery arm of both Departmental and Government programs, services and benefits. The combined Department has a workforce of 24,OOO employees. Service Canada is located in all regions of the country through which the programs and services of ESDC, as well as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone or through the Internet. ESDC operates in a complex governance and accountability structure as it supports two Ministers and a Minister of State (Seniors), two Parliamentary Secretaries, a Deputy Minister, a Senior Associate Deputy Minister and Chief Operating Officer, a Deputy Minister of Labour and an Associate Deputy Minister. The Department also has complex interfaces for service delivery to Canadians and shared corporate services through the Service Canada Initiative. The operating environment is made more complex by the primary jurisdiction of provincial/territorial governments for the delivery of early childhood development, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary programs, in addition to areas of shared jurisdiction. Program Context Evaluation is a vital component of the Government of Canada's accountability and decision making process. It ensures managers can operate effectively, by supporting their efforts to track and report on performance and provides decision-makers, up to and including the Deputy Minister, with neutral information to help them objectively assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and results of programs and policies and make informed decisions about their future (i.e. improvements, cancellation, reallocation, etc.). The Evaluation Directorate is responsible for adapting and implementing within ESDC the federal government's evaluation program and its modernization agenda. The Treasury Board policy on evaluation broadens the scope of the evaluation universe, and increases the sophistication and rigour of strategically-focused methodologies. Within this context, evaluations focus broadly on the success of overall departmental efforts to meet strategic goals, as well as the specific objectives of individual programs and initiatives. Findings from performance evaluation activities must be systematically integrated into departmental strategic planning and used by management in developing new program initiatives in order to ensure the effective stewardship of financial and non-financial resources to serve Canadians. These findings must also address the need to measure the performance of program/service delivery and to optimize resource efficiency and cost effectiveness (i.e. value-for money). Further, the Evaluation Directorate must also provide consultative advice that is both strategic and proactive in nature, intended to identify potential issues that could impede the achievement of results, and to recommend improvements and solutions. 2
The Position/ Executive Role Within this context, the Director Partnership Evaluation is the Department's dedicated lead for all evaluation activities related to programs funded by the federal government but run via partnerships with other levels of government and third parties. These complex programs exist as the result of careful relationship building and stakeholder management so related evaluation activities must be designed to ensure that the funding provided results in the delivery of pre-established objectives. In this tegard, the Director is accountable for supporting the design and development of a comprehensive evaluation framework and strategic plan that will provide the DG and ultimately the Departmental Evaluation Committee (DEC) led by the Deputy Minister with independent, strategically focused, objective, evidence- based, timely, pertinent and credible evaluation findings and conclusions. These findings and conclusions must support the development of advice and recommendations on the relevance, success and cost-effectiveness of the current partnership programs and on the need to terminate, institute, refine or modify these initiatives. The incumbent directs the conduct of multiple, complex, multi-disciplinary evaluations and ensures the application of rigorous standards in the design and development of evaluation methodologies in a manner that will optimize evaluation results. The Director is accountable for ensuring that program evaluation activities are systematic, objective and comprehensive and that results can be used to provide an independent assessment of the relevance and performance of the related departmental programs, as weil as information used for decision-making and reporting. He/she establishes the objectives, scope and timing of program evaluation initiatives, identifies the methodologies to be used in the conduct of evaluation projects so as to ensure that appropriate conclusions may be derived from findings, and assesses the reliability, neutrality, understandability and completeness of the evidence. The incumbent ensure that evaluations are conducted in accordance with government standards and policies, that quality evaluation results are delivered on time and within budget, and that the results of completed evaluations, frameworks and studies are disseminated in a timely manner. The Director is responsible for developing recommendations to the DG Evaluation on the Priorities, plans and schedules for related evaluation studies. He/she must ensure that program evaluation activities are planned in such a way as to address both current and potential critical issues and that activities are scheduled appropriately to respond to senior management's information requirements, the requirements of central agencies, as well as the operational requirements of line managers. The Director provides expert, professional advice, guidance and assistance to the DG to provide independent, objective, strategically-focused and cost effective evaluation activities, and a detailed examination and assessment of ESDC's strategic approaches. The Director provides advice and guidance to senior departmental managers to support the design or improve performance measurement strategies for new or renewed partnership programs and initiatives which clearly define expected results, and that embody sound performance measurement, reporting and accountability provisions at their outset. To this end, the Director must ensure that evaluations provide proactive information and recommendations that will allow the department to take timely action to ensure that programs and services are achieving results and that areas identified as problems or issues are resolved. Significant Challenges Provide consultative guidance to the department in selecting and developing performance measures and applying lessons learned from evaluation activities.

Key activities The federal Anti-Racism Secretariat (ARSEC) is responsible for identifying and monitoring new and existing federal initiatives that address racism and discrimination; publicly reporting on whole of government outcomes; and identifying the policies and practices entrenched in our established institutions that result in the exclusion or promotion of particular groups (systemic racism).

Building a Foundation for Change: Canada s Anti-Racism Strategy, 2OI9-2O22 is a $45 million investment that takes immediate steps to combat racism and discrimination based on what was heard during a community engagement process and supported by research.

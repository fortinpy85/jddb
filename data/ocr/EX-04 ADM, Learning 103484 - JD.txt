Assistant Deputy Minister, Learning 2 August 2OO7
Human Resources and Social Development Canada NATURE AND SCOPE The mission of Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development of policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life's transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. As both a policy and program centre, HRSDC is accountable for the development and implementation of policies, strategies, frameworks and initiatives that integrate and harmonize the mandates of the three organization entities at the corporate level. This corporate leadership and coordination role ensures the Ministers, Secretary of State, Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are provided with considered and consistent advice that represents the collective views of HRSDC, Labour Branch and Service Canada. The Minister, HRSDC is supported by one Deputy Minister and a Senior Associate Deputy Minister for HRSDC, a Deputy Minister for Labour Branch and a Deputy Head for Service Canada. HRSDC is responsible for policy and program development, Labour Branch promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment and Service Canada is the delivery arm of Government programs, services and benefits. The combined HRSDC and Labour Branch workforce is thirty-six hundred and Service Canada has an additional twenty- three thousand employees. Service Canada is located in all regions of the Country through which the programs and services of HRSDC, as well as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone or through the Internet. HRSD operates in a complex governance and accountability structure as it supports two Ministers, two Parliamentary Secretaries; a Deputy Minister, a Senior Associate Deputy Minister, and a Deputy Minister, Labour Branch and has complex interfaces for service delivery to Canadians and shared corporate services through the Service Canada Initiative. In the area of lifelong learning, the operating environment is made more complex by the primary jurisdiction of provincial/territorial governments for the delivery of early childhood development, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary programs. It is within this context that the ADM, Learning Programs is responsible for the realignment and renewal of learning and post-secondary student financial assistance programs allocated to the Branch, for shaping and influencing policies in the areas of student post secondary education (PSE) financial assistance, international student exchanges and adult learning in order to provide authoritative and proactive support to the Ministers, the DM and the Senior Associate DM; developing and overseeing the implementation of the measures announced in the Speech from the Throne and other federal and departmental priorities; ensuring that the vision and mission and all strategic and business priorities and plans and resource expenditures of the Branch fully reflect and are integrated with the department's Vision and Mission; and establishing the Branch s planning, accountability, performance measurement and reporting frameworks and practices in line with central agency and HRSDC policies and directives. These are large and complex challenges, combining those associated with setting the corporate and cultural direction for a new Department and Branch, as well as those inherent in aligning the Branch within the broad priorities, strategies and socio economic directions of Cabinet and the federal government. The Branch has a resource base of 368 FTEs, annual operating Assistant Deputy Minister, Learning 3 August 2OO7
Human Resources and Social Development Canada expenditures and spending of $35.5 Million and portfolio management of over $I.I7 Billion in Grants & Contributions and statutory payments. The first challenge faced by the ADM is to lead the development of the Branch 's overarching vision and mission, which are essential in order for the Branch to meet its several programs, policy and service delivery challenges in the setting of a new Department. S/he must create the sense of team work required to integrate and realign internal and external organizations and parties involved in the federal Learning, International Education Mobility and PSE financial assistance portfolios. This requires developing and implementing the appropriate structures, resource allocations and skills deployment across the Branch and working to engage managers and staff in contributing to the new Branch s priorities, and to its business planning. In performing these activities the ADM ensures the reflection and incorporation of the corporate HRSDC Vision and Mission statements and the priorities of Cabinet, the Minister and DM as well as the senior Corporate Committees and the Management Board. A critical element of this challenge is the need to create a culture in which learning initiatives are seen by all staff as integral parts of the government's broad priority of strengthening the economic and social foundations of Canadian life. This will require a focus on a Branch-wide, proactive use of the policy function (e.g., research, benchmarking, consultation, analysis, design, development, testing and implementation), and a stronger program and operational policy capacity within the program Directorates than has traditionally existed. The ADM must establish and maintain the Branch s service delivery mandate, but at the same time must ensure that the Learning business line provides an effective instrument for addressing the government's macro-economic and socio-economic priorities. For example, the ADM leads the complex and highly sensitive management of federal-provincial educational issues. The ADM must forge strong consultative networks and information linkages with other federal departments, provincial and municipal governments as well as non-governmental organizations. S/he must also involve related federal HRSDC portfolios such as employment programs Workplace Skills Development, etc., to create synergies around the Lifelong Learning Agenda. These networks allow the continuous identification of the evolving priorities of the Learning Agenda and the possible impacts on the Branch in order that proactive responses and transitions can be made, if required, in its program policy and service delivery frameworks and required services to the DMs and Ministers. These linkages also allow the inclusion of these parties in the development of the Branch's priorities and policy and program design and delivery frameworks, and lessen the prevalence of functional silos across the Branch. The governance of the Learning Branch, under the authority of the ADM Learning, must be responsive to current central agency and HRSDC imperatives such as: modern management and comptrollership; enhanced accountability, evaluation and reporting; enhanced service delivery which integrates to the greatest degree all departmental and, whenever possible, federal programming; reduction of duplication with programs provided by other levels of government; and the emphasis on strong horizontal linkages to enhance data sharing and decision-making and to break down the traditional, vertical service delivery models that characterized former departmental program operations. The ADM's leadership also enables the Branch to respond appropriately to new central agency initiatives and to satisfy the critical scrutiny of the central agencies, all levels of government, the Canadian public-at-large and the media. These drivers emphasize the need for the ADM to establish strong governance frameworks for the Branch; especially for its public funding allocations and appropriations. There are three major spheres of activity and accountability for the ADM, namely promoting and enhancing Learning and international education mobility, as well as access to learning via Assistant Deputy Minister, Learning 4 August 2OO
Human Resources and Social Development Canada student financial assistance programs (CSLP, CESG), and delivering sound policy integration and planning. The ADM leads the Learning Directorate in its new organizational setting, to meet its policy and program priorities and federal commitments related to the Skills and Learning agenda. These include: accelerating the development of the national infrastructures to promote life-long learning as a key ingredient to the economic and social development of all Canadians and to their participation in the work force/place; and implementing new savings and asset- based programs to support lifelong learning and developing innovative fiscal and investment approaches to foster means and ways for families and individuals to plan, save, or access funding to pay for education, training and learning opportunities; as well as providing $3.4M in contributions annually to the Canadian academic PSE community to develop and maintain international exchange programs whereby students gain skills relevant to an increasingly global work environment and Canadian institutions build partnerships and joint curricula in key academic sectors. The ADM also leads this Directorate in the ongoing development and national administration of learning strategies, the advancement of learning technologies through leading- edge research and demonstration and joint federal-provincial projects, the Canada Education Savings Grants program, the development and provision of modern national initiatives and programs focussed primarily on adult learners, as well as the development of policy and associated programs in support of international learning initiatives. The Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP) has always been important, however, its profile has recently increased due to the world-wide recognition of the value of PSE to the economic well-being of Canadians and the rising cost of post-secondary education in the preceding decade which has made financing post-secondary education harder for Canadians. The federal government has had to ensure that CSLP is modern in assisting those with the greatest need, and that its investments and associated application processes and criteria are viable and best meet and further the program's goals and objectives. The ADM has also had to oversee the repatriation of those service delivery activities formerly conducted by the Banks, prior to March 2OOO. This has meant a large increase in the actual administrative, management and service delivery responsibilities of this program, which resulted in it being elevated from Division to Directorate status due to its much larger scope and the magnitude of the resource base required for its administration (i.e., 25O FTEs). The new program responsibilities also resulted in the need to develop and implement new functions for the CSLP, including the negotiation and oversight of new contract arrangements with third party service providers, stronger monitoring and reporting capacities, a new automated control and management system to effectively record and track all activities and to assist in monitoring and identifying areas of default, delinquency or fraud, and a strengthened capacity to intervene in areas where irregularities or non-compliance occur to resolve situations before they incur liabilities for the federal government. As the funds administered through this program are over $I3 billion and the program supports close to 45O,OOO Canadian students each year, it is imperative that all aspects of the CSLP s planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting are professionally performed as they are of significant importance to the DM and Ministers as well as to the central agencies and Parliament. During the development phase and for ongoing activities, the ADM will form strong linkages with HRSDC program and corporate functional Branches to ensure the proper orientation of its required systems and services in these fields and the establishment of effective operating interfaces with corporate Branches. In addition, the ADM will oversee the ongoing harmonization and integration of student financial assistance programs across Canada, in collaboration with provincial/territorial governments, including the development of new innovative models of student financial assistance. All of these priorities pose a considerable challenge for the ADM. In order to position Canada as a world-wide leader in the area of promoting and enhancing jearning, they all require Assistant Deputy Minister, Learning 5 August 2OO7
Human Resources and Social Development Canada considerable socio-economic analysis, benchmarking against international practices, as well as program policy development, including extensive collaboration with the Strategic Policy and Research Branch and other HRSDC organizations, and with external governmental, public, private and voluntary sector organizations who share a common interest in enhancing the well being of Canadians in the context of a knowledge based economy. This is especially the case with the Provinces which have primary jurisdiction in many of these policy and program areas. The ADM also delivers strong support to the Ministers and to the DM. In the area of planning and performance management, the ADM will be challenged to develop processes and approaches appropriate to the mandate and structure of the new Branch, while at the same time responding to the requirements of broader departmental planning/performance processes.

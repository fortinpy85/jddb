NATURE & SCOPE The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada to support Canadians to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians quality of life. Many of the federal government's largest and most well-known programs and services are provided by the Department in fulfillment of its broad mandate. As a result, ESDC is a major user of personal information and other data to deliver key programs and services to Canadians, as well as to deliver programs and services on behalf of other federal institutions. ESDC operates within one of the most complex privacy regimes in government, within which it carries out the vast scale and scope of the Department's collection, use, retention, and disclosure activities. ESDC started the journey to modernization in 2OI6 using its Service Strategy as the department-wide modernization plan of action as the foundation for service delivery transformation as it continues to evolve. An Act to amend the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act of I983 received royal assent on June 2I, 2OI9, making important improvements to the openness and transparency of government. Under the new legislation, the Information Commissioner has the power to make binding orders related to access to information requests, fees are reduced, and institutions must proactively publish specific information known to be of interest to the public. Against the backdrop of department-wide service transformation and legislative change, the Corporate Secretariat is modernizing ATIP services by restructuring, investing in new technology, such as ATIPXpress and modernizing business processes. The Executive Director, Access and Open Information Policy and Operations is the lead on ATIP-related transformative activities and acts as the driver in ongoing innovation and evolution of ATIP service delivery in compliance with the Act and open and transparent government objectives, including to build and sustain proactive disclosure practices. The incumbent provides leadership in using an agile methodology that involves policy and operations in one Division. Policy to Service Continuum framework involves developing or modifying ATIP policies, with changes driven by regulatory or legislative amendments, and new/amended ATIP program policy measures. The strength of the model lies in its integrated and inclusive approach, underpinned by standard operating processes (SOP). This means that at the development stage, policy options are viewed from the Operations perspective to identify the feasibility of policy approaches and their impacts on operations and service delivery allowing adjustments to be made early in the process. The Executive Director oversees the formation of working groups comprised of policy specialists and operations service providers that together delineate issues, articulate policy intent, operationalize in a timely fashion and improve service delivery. To ensure the integrity of policy and program development processes across the continuum, the incumbent oversees a rigorous approach is applied in the agile model as it is in traditional development process. The Executive Director provides well-informed, integrated advice, briefings and recommendations to the Corporate Secretary/Chief Privacy Officer, executives in the Offices of Primary Interest (OPI) and other senior officials across the Department. The incumbent frequently briefs Ministers Offices, DMO, and at times may be called upon to brief Ministers and is expected to provide expert recommendations on issues involving the interpretation and application of ATIP, where such issues can become contentious, attracting attention of the media and from Parliamentarians. The Executive Director is expected to play a challenge role regarding legislative compliance/non-compliance by the OPls and also on operational matters 3
affecting the national workload. In this capacity, the incumbent must be able to reconcile, though not compromise, where OPIs hold differing positions because ultimately the Corporate Secretary/Chief Privacy Officer is accountable for compliance. The Executive Director faces a significant challenge in leading and effecting change, as there are changes in every aspect of the work. The incumbent directs the development and implementation of changes driven by open and transparent government objectives, the centralization and standardization of ATIP operations in the context of the policy to service continuum, and the implementation of supporting tools and technologies. Changes must be implemented concurrently which requires strategic and detailed planning, especially where changes are interdependent. The incumbent ensures the identification of training needs and directs the development of coherent learning plans that produce a skilled, trained and integrated workforce as well as creating mandatory training programs for OPls. Further, all of this must be accomplished in tandem with maintaining the service standards of the existing decentralized model. The Executive Director is accountable for a rigorous monitoring and reporting regime for ATIP Operations. The incumbent oversees the development and regular updating of the performance management framework to meet program objectives and enhance performance. Quality management and quality assurance for ATIP operations signal the need for a change to policy and/or programs and associated data form part of the inputs to reports both internally and externally. The Executive Director ensures the standardized capture of data that can produce accurate statistics and provide input to central agency and parliamentary annual reporting. Data capture and analytics is essential to both the oversight role and the policy to service continuum model. The Executive Director is accountable for the preparation and production of the Department's annual reports to Parliament on the administration of the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act. Relying on the quality of data holdings of the Division, the Report must be accurate and comprehensive, dealing with every aspect of the administration of the Acts. The Report reflects in detail every aspect of the performance of the Department in fulfilling statutory requirements. As well, the Executive Director oversees the preparation of the annual report on fees collected by ESDC in compliance with Service Fees Act. These reports tabled in Parliament highlight the importance of data capture and management and demand the incumbent's rigorous management and documentation of all ATIP-related processes. The Executive Director oversees the development of an internal communications plan with a clear method of communication and ensures that it is sustained by respective working groups. The incumbent directs the development and dissemination of public education messaging that informs requestors that digitalized services are available and that responses to online requests are generally more expedient. To facilitate the change for the public, the Executive Director oversees the development of standardized, streamlined and accessible communications materials and templates created to reinforce consistent client service. The Executive Director represents the interests and positions of the Division and Secretariat in inter/intradepartmental consultations and negotiations to build consensus on ATIP-related positions that cut across mandates and involve OPls with different priorities. The incumbent forms and maintains horizontal partnerships within and outside of ESDC, representing the Department with central agencies (TBS, PCO) and the Office of the Information Commissioner, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to build positive collaboration and alignment. Further, the Executive Director undertakes risk assessments and is called upon frequently to 4
assess portfolio risk and report to Ministers Offices, DMO, and Corp Sec, as well as working closely with legal experts, branches and OGDs on high visibility information requests. The incumbent liaises with PASRB for responsive media lines, and also with Parliamentary Affairs on order paper questions and the production of papers. In this capacity, the Executive Director draws on strong people skills, poise and pragmatism in providing advice and recommendations to senior management which may not be immediately accepted. The Executive Director leads by influence and example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining professional expertise. The incumbent is a member of senior management committees and influences decisions on policies, programs, and investments. The Executive Director must demonstrate strong management and operational skills, sound judgement and operating environment acumen, and manage allocated resources with probity.

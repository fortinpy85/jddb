c NATURE AND SCOPE Service Canada integrates services from a number of federal departments to form an easy-to-access network of multi-channel service delivery through a national network of call centres, mobile outreach, Internet-based services and traditional mail, in-person and paper channels. These services touch all aspects of the lives of Canadians: from parental and pension benefits, to matching employers with job seekers, applying for a passport and obtaining a Social Insurance Number. This network brings together 32O points of service in communities throughout Canada; a national I-8OO-O-Canada telephone service providing Canadians with information about all federal government services, and a range of on-line services. In 2OO6, Service Canada s points of service will double, reaching I.25 million more Canadians and giving access to many remote and rural communities previously under-served. One of the primary ways this will be done is through mobile outreach - scheduled or in response to a particular need -- by travelling Service Canada representatives. The new model of service delivery also includes the development of effective service and referral linkages to provincial, territorial and municipal governments. A critical feature of the Service Canada vision is the idea of managing the service strategy and the resulting integrated delivery network on an enterprise-wide basis, encompassing almost all interactions between the Government of Canada and citizens. The public policy and program/service delivery issues of Service Canada are at the centre of the federal government's policy agenda. The strategic objectives of the Department for 2OO6-2OO7 are to: Deliver seamless citizen-centered service; e Enhance the integrity of programs: e Work as a Collaborative government: e Demonstrate accountable and responsible government e Build a culture of service excellence. The key priority for the Marketing & Communications Branch is to build a strong and positive Service Canada brand through mixed-media campaigns, and partnership with other Government Departments and the private sector. It is in this context that the Director of Strategic Communications and Operations is responsible for providing and coordinating all Communications services to the aforementioned Branches and in changing traditional service delivery concepts and models. A major new thrust for the Marketing & Communications Division's activities and expertise is the need to provide advisory, capacity building and enabling services to its clients in the Branch to assist them in the development of new information products and outreach approaches. In this way the Director has a strong impact on the success of the Branches in reaching and communicating with its external clients, stakeholders
& and partners, including the general public and special target groups. The Director has a dual role. In the first instance, he/she is a member of the Marketing & Communications Branch s Management Team and its management Committee. In the second role, the incumbent is the expert Communications manager and service provider to the assigned Client Branches and its Management Team and Committee and programs. Through the first role, the Director makes a strong contribution to the corporate and national Communications vision, goals, objectives, priorities and strategic orientation of the Branch. He/She is also a key member in the development and maintenance of the Branch s national planning, policy, procedural and service/program delivery frameworks. As part of this corporate Communications management cadre, he/she can be tasked with investigating national issues affecting the Communications Program and its responsiveness to senior management of Service Canada as well as to the Department's external clients. This involves the chairing of Committees and the leadership of Project Teams often composed of communications experts, consultants and program managers. Similarly, the incumbent can be assigned to represent Service Canada on a central agency driven, or an interdepartmental Committee or Project Team, responsible for analyzing a federal government-wide Communications policy or program issue or developing a major Communications initiative. As part of the corporate Communications responsibilities, the Director must establish strong horizontal policy and service delivery linkages with his/her colleagues in the Branch are other Divisions. Regarding the corporate functional positions, (i.e., Strategic Communications, Corporate and Regional Communications and Ministerial Services), the Director must advocate the interests and priorities of his/her assigned client Branch to these officials to ensure they are adequately considered and reflected in actions and initiatives they will take or lead. Similarly, the Director must also act as the focal point to represent the priorities and corporate strategies and business orientations of the Communications Branch with the client ADM and his/her Management Team and organization. This ensures the optimal harmonization of the corporate Communications Branch and the client Branch s communications strategies, orientations, products, services and systems and maximizes resource effort while avoiding duplication and inconsistencies. The Director also deals with his/her colleagues in the other Branch Communications Divisions to ensure opportunities for joint action or integrated messages are identified and acted upon. Through these contacts the incumbent also ensures consistency in service delivery and shares best practices and lessons learned. While this corporate role is of importance to Service Canada national Communications
c program, the greatest percentage of time is spent on its second role and responsibilities; that is the Communications Manager and expert advisor to his/her assigned client Branch. Due to the management model utilized in the Communications Branch, the Director has great autonomy and authority to provide services, products and activities to the client organization. It is expected he/she will do so in accordance with the corporate Communications vision, priorities and frameworks however; he/she has the latitude to adapt these to meet the Client Branch s specific needs and to further its outreach to its external clients, stakeholders and partners. A major challenge for the Director is in turning around a communications program that was previously reactive and issues-driven. This requires him/her to reorient the perspectives, work habits and service delivery practices of the Division's staff so they focus on the conceptualization and delivery of proactive and innovative services, products and activities. This needs sensitive management and handling to gain their agreement and acceptance of the new priorities and approaches. It also requires providing training and development to staff members to assist them in adjusting to the new service delivery regime and its strategic and business orientations and directions. Part of the new approach is to facilitate the development of a better communications capacity within the client Branch s programs to assist it in implementing new Service Canada priorities (e.g., enhanced outreach; greater access to services and knowledge/information bases through increased use of electronic and other Service Canada leading-edge communications technologies, systems and products; citizen engagement, etc.). As such the Director must develop and sustain an awareness of the importance of strong communications delivery and support within the management cadre of the assigned client Branch and must establish a level of confidence with the ADM and Branch Management Committee. He/She sits as a member of the Committee and is the expert advisor and strategist for all policy and program initiatives and activities requiring communications support and/or products and services. In many cases the line managers do not fully realize the role communications can play to facilitate their activities outside of issues management and other traditional services (e.g., Ministerial Services, media relations, publications, events) which have always been a strong requirement for the program. The incumbent must continue to provide strong expertise and support in these areas while inculcating an acceptance of the value of new communications services (e.g., public opinion research, social marketing, service and product testing)> he/She must also promote the essential need for the early involvement of the Communications Division in major policy and program launches and in conducting analyses and scans to determine the perspectives of the media and key client, stakeholder and partner publics for the client Branch s programs. As well, the Director must advocate the ability of the Division to play a pivotal role in
& assisting programs realize their priorities for better knowledge and information brokering services, and the development of products, services and maior initiatives to promote their program's activities and services to Canadians. This is complicated by the fact that due to devolution, co-management and other alternative service delivery mechanisms, often the input and acceptance of other external parties are required in cases where the Branch is involved in these shared service delivery scenarios. This can require extensive negotiation on the content of releases and announcements and on promotional material to ensure optimum profile and recognition of Service Canada and federal involvement and expenditures. A key function of the Director is to lead all communications planning for the client Branch and to develop and implement service contracts with its ADM and Management Committee. This requires driving a consensus among programs that have different priorities, service delivery platforms and often different client, stakeholder and partner organizations. It is imperative that the Director gets these senior managers (e.g., ADM, Associate ADM, DGs) to focus on the macro-communications priorities and activities of the Branch in order to build the strategic and operational communications plans required for its major policy and/or program initiatives. As much as possible, the Director will act as a catalyst to promote and achieve the economies and enhanced effectiveness and profile that can be attained by integrated initiatives and messages. From the planning frameworks the Branch 's daily and long term service delivery in all areas of communications flows. As mentioned earlier, the Director provides directly, or coordinates the delivery through or with the corporate Communications functional groups and external companies, of all communications services, systems and products. This includes all traditional services (e.g., Ministerial and media relations, advertising, promotion, writing and editing, media analysis/monitoring, public enquiries, creative services, development and production of audio-visuals, publications, events/exhibits, etc.) as well as state-of-the-art services (e.g., Intra/Internet, public opinion research, social marketing, Web Sites, CD-ROMs, etc.). The incumbent also ensures the Branch is provided with appropriate information technology to support the cost effective management of all communications activities and to establish appropriate information linkages with the Regions and other key external organizations. As the client Branch's key communications advisor and service provider, the Director leads all national communications activities and initiatives related to the client Branch s specific policy and program areas. When one considers the scope and size of Service Canada the challenge of effectively implementing the required functional direction networks and frameworks is obviously large. In many cases the Director must assess, for the ADM and senior Branch management, the capacity of the Regional Communications and Program organizations to deliver the required communications services or initiative given their resource allocations and the competing priorities they face at the Regional level. In many instances, he/she will, in fact, determine the strategic and business approach and will oversee the development of needed products
iS and services and provide corporate direction and assistance to the regional staff to assist them in the rollout of this initiative. If the project or initiative requires substantial resource effort or specialized expertise, the Director will participate in the hiring of required consulting capacity and skill sets. He/She monitors the roll-out of these initiatives and also evaluates their impact and effectiveness in reaching target and general audiences and publics and in promoting the federal, Service Canada, and Branch interests and involved policy or program initiatives or issue. Linked to the functional networks with the Regions both at the communications and program levels is the responsibility of the incumbent to assist the ADM in best promoting the client Branch s profile and policy and program initiatives, activities and issues across Service Canada and with national and international publics. This assists both corporate and regional managers and staff involved in, or affected by, the delivery of the Branch s programs in best understanding their interfaces and responsibilities. This internal communications function is an important aspect of Service Canada s vision as it relates to promoting an understanding among staff of the overall service delivery of the department and the need to integrate its programs to the greatest degree and to also support managers and staff in adjusting to new policy and program requirements. The Director will not only oversee Branch specific internal communications announcements and activities but will contribute the assigned client Branch 's perspective and priorities to Service Canada integrated internal communications initiatives, activities and messaging. The incumbent provides the corporate leadership to the client Branch in developing, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of its strategic and business communications plans. The Director must ensure that a consistent, integrated approach to communications prevails throughout the Branch and achieves this by developing service standards and performance indicators in consultation with communications specialists in PCO, the Communications Branch, and Regions and with managers across the assigned program. A major challenge is the provision of creative advertising, audio-visual and exhibit design/display services for the Branch across Canada. This is a growing priority for the federal government which wants to ensure that the federal role, responsibilities and funding levels are understood and appreciated by Canadians who can often mistake federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictions, actions and contributions. The Director provides such services directly to the corporate offices of the Branch and for national issues and campaigns, and coordinates regional service delivery through exercising authoritative fractional direction. These services are key to the successful communication of Service Canada and Branch policy and program initiatives and public education and social marketing messages and campaigns. The Director assists the DG in preparing for, or in sponsoring major presentations to the Department's Management Board and Executive Committees. Similarly he/she will be
involved extensively in initiatives and activities involving the DM's and the Minister's Offices, Cabinet, other Minister's Offices and Parliamentarians due to his/her awareness of the Branch s corporate positions on policy and program matters and the need to coordinate these within Service Canada and with other federal departments, other levels of government and key external stakeholders and partners. In these roles, the incumbent discharges considerable influence on the strategic priorities and direction that will guide the Branch and govern its interaction with domestic and international clients, stakeholders and partners during this period of fundamental reorientation of the federal human resources development governance and management regimes. The Director has frequent contact with officials of the central agencies (e.g., PCO, PMO, Canada Communications Group), provincial/territorial departments, and other federal departments (e.g., Health Canada, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Industry Canada, Fisheries and Oceans and other economic and social agencies). The incumbent also performs frequent representational activities with senior representatives of domestic and foreign industry, foreign governments, international organizations, community groups, lobby and special interest groups and universities.

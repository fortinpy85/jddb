Nature and Scope Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the Department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. It is one of the largest and most complex federal departments. It employs over 29,OOO people and its activities account for almost one out of every three dollars spent by the federal government. The ESDC Portfolio (encompassing the Department, Labour Program and Service Canada) operates within a highly matrixed governance structure and operating model, supporting four Ministers (i.e. Minister of Families, Children and Social Development: Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability inclusion ; Minister of Labour; and Minister of Seniors). Portfolio organizations operate with five (5) distinct sources of funding the Consolidated Dir, National Accounts Payable Page 2 of 7 April I, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada Revenue Fund, the Employment Insurance Operating Account, the Canada Pension Base Account, the Canada Pension Additional Account, and the Passport Revolving Fund, and deliver a large number of diverse programs to Canadians. Overall Portfolio expenditures are projected to be $I38.3 Billion in FY 2OI9-2O. ESDC has a broad mandate that includes social policies and programs, including Labour, and the delivery of a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives. For example, the Department provides seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education, and assists parents who are taising young children. The Labour Program contributes to social and economic well-being by fostering safe, healthy, fair and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the federal jurisdiction. Service Canada helps citizens access ESDC s programs, as well as other Government of Canada programs and services. Additionally, ESDC now has legislative authority to deliver services on behalf of other organizations and must therefore recover costs for these activities, which adds additional complexity to service delivery operations. ESDC is both a policy and a service organization. As a policy department it plays a significant role in the Government's policy agenda which supports delivery of a number of programs, including over 4O statutory grants and contributions programs. The Policy Branch of ESDC is responsible for the policies of all 4O programs delivered by the Department. These programs include CPP, Employment Insurance, and OAS, as well in excess of 4O Grants and Contributions programs. The Policy Branch has 5 separate sub-branches each with its own area of specialty. These are the Strategy and Service Policy Branch, the Skills and Employment Branch (SEB), the Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD), the Labour Program Branch, and the Learning Branch, with total FTEs in excess of 26OO employees. As a service organization", ESDC reaches virtually every Canadian through over 58O of Service Canada's points of service across the country, by phone, in person, or on-line through the canada.ca website. Service Canada, which began operations in late 2OO5 with a mandate to provide Canadians with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits, accounts for the majority of operating results of the Department, employing approximately I7,OOO employees across Canada. Through Service Canada, the Department is responsible for delivering over $I2O Billion in benefits directly to individuals and organizations through such Government of Canada programs and services, such as Employment Insurance, Old Age Security, the Canada Pension Plan, Passport Receiving Agent Services, the Social Insurance Number, and the Canada Student Loans Program. The Department also provides $4.8 Billion in funding to other levels of government, educators and organizations in the voluntary and private sectors. Service Canada is currently undergoing significant change to its operations due to modernization efforts, the greater number of grants and contributions programs, and increased responsibilities in the realm of service delivery. Significant large scale projects include the closing of 34 Passport Canada Offices across the country and the incorporation of Passport Canada services in the Service Canada sites. Another project involves modernizing Canada s legacy benefit payments system, and recently ESDC has enacted legislation that enables Service Canada to deliver services for partners (OGDs and external organizations) with ensuing cost recovery agreements. This transition and the subsequent increase in complexity necessitates the evaluation and reoptimization of existing service strategies and plans, as well as financial management processes to accommodate this scale up in responsibility, while maintaining a high service standard and prudent financial stewardship. The Government of Canada has undergone significant changes in business planning, resource allocation, financial management, financial and non-financial reporting, and service delivery Dir, National Accounts Payable Page 3 of 7 April I, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada methods. Among these are changes to TBS roles and capacities to provide more rigorous oversight of government expenditures; measures to strengthen internal control practices, including increased emphasis on effective control, oversight and monitoring systems, to ensure that value for public money is a core consideration in spending, review and management decisions; the establishment of stronger financial controls to ensure the rigorous stewardship of public funds; the requirement for proactive disclosure of travel, hospitality, grants and contributions, and contracting activities; and increased emphasis on internal audit and evaluation. Pursuant to the requirements of the Treasury Board Policy on Financial Management, ESDC must continue to assess its system of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and the areas related to Internal Controls over Financial Management (ICFM} that are not addressed in the assessment of ICFR. Communicated in the 2OI9-2O Management Accountability Framework, there is an expectation that all departments should reach the ongoing monitoring stage in all areas of ICFM by 2O23. The ICAAD Directorate of the CFO Branch is responsible for ensuring adherence to general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all 4 sets of financial statements, providing departmental accounts payable and receivable operations, grants and contributions financial monitoring, relocation, proactive disclosure and accounting operations services, as well as the development of departmental financial policies and internal control frameworks, and associated processes and procedures. Within this highly complex environment, the Director, National Accounts Payable, establishes the Directorate as the Centre of Expertise in the Department on national accounts payable operations, including payments made to Canadians through its diverse social programs, such as, inter alia, Employment Insurance, CPP and OAS, payments for Grants and Contributions programs that cannot be executed within the Program Branches, payments to federal employees to address payment issues emanating from the Phoenix pay system, other payments to employees, such as reimbursement of travel claims, interdepartmental settlements, and large payments in excess of $25 Million. The Director directs the development and implementation of the framework for accounts payable operations including all policies procedures, systems and tools governing the work. Establishes collaborative working relationships with the twelve program heads in ESDC to identify and advise on the current status of grants and contributions payment activities that cannot be performed by the program branches themselves. The Director is the Department's lead executive in the management and evolution of its accounts payable system. The Director provides oversight to the reimbursement of expenses for all ESDC employees and executives, including those in the Ministers offices. These expenses include travel expenses, tax slips, Ministerial vehicles, parking reimbursements, etc. The Director also provides oversight to ensure that business expense accounts of departmental managers and staff on travel status are being used appropriately and in the event of complicated or complex issues, provide expert guidance and advice at the most senior level to resolve them.

The Director ensures that any new or enhanced procedures and policies adhere to central agency and auditor requirements, and provides oversight to the evolution of Directorate operations to increase efficiency, innovation and speed in the payment of accounts payables for the Department. The Director also provides leadership to projects and pilot tests of innovative solutions that can further improve and evolve operations in order to take advantage of new technology, as well as of new techniques and methodologies to improve services provided by the Directorate to clients both within the Department as well as to the Canadian public. The Director directs ESDC s participation in Government-wide fora to develop, test and implement potential improvements related to the stabilization of the Phoenix pay system to improve the capabilities of the system from the standpoint of ESDC s accounts payables. The Director works with other senior executives at ESDC and with PSPC to identify both potential improvements and pilot projects that could improve the stabilization of Phoenix and resolution of pay issues. The Director provides oversight to associated pilot projects, ensures the accurate collection of performance data, and provides expert recommendations on ESDC s requirements, including recommendations to PSPC on Phoenix stabilization efforts.

The Director provides expert advice and guidance to the Director General, ICAAD and the CFO on all national accounts payable issues. There are several challenges for the position. First, ESDC is a very large Department with a considerable budget that distributes large sums of money through a wide variety of essential programs and services that many people across Canada rely on to survive. From OAS helping the elderly to El helping the unemployed, ESDC programs are essential to meeting the monthly expenses of millions across the country. While some of these payments are processed by the program Branches themselves, a considerable number are processed centrally by the National Accounts Payable Directorate. The Director is the authority within the Department on ensuring that these payments go out accurately and on time. This represents a challenge for the position and there is significant pressure to ensure timely payments as any interruption can cause significant hardship to Canadians. Additionally, this represents a challenge for the position as these programs are highly political due to their importance to so many, and any interruption can also cause significant embarrassment and political consequences for elected officials. This challenge is further exacerbated by the implementation of new programs or unforeseen emergencies that can dramatically scale both the volume and the complexity of required payments. The smooth operation of the Phoenix pay system is essential to ensuring that federal employees receive the correct salary at the correct time. This system is extraordinarily complex and as a result, there are errors that occur that can result in under payment, over payment, or no payment Dir, National Accounts Payable Page S of 7 April I, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada at all. This represents a challenge for the position who is responsible for the review and reconciliation of pay issues to ensure these are properly accounted for in the OFMS. The Director is also under considerable pressure to ensure that processes related to the issuance of Emergency Salary Advances and Priority payments allow for timely issuance of payments to employees that are affected by under payment or no pay situations as lack of payment can cause financial hardship for employees and carries with it the potential for political embarrassment. ESDC programs and operations are constantly audited to ensure fiscal responsibility, accountability and transparency. This represents a challenge for the position as the Director must ensure that comprehensive records and tracking of all accounts payable activities are kept and are capable of withstanding audit. The Director must ensure that all Directorate operations are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency to maintain public trust and allow ESDC's programs to keep making positive contributions to the lives of Canadians. In all financial jobs, occasionally there are exceptions that fall outside of existing procedures or policies that require additional analysis and authority to resolve and accounts payable operations is no exception. In these instances, the Director, as the executive authority for accounts payable for ESDC, is required to make executive determinations on how to resolve matters that have required escalation. This represents a significant challenge for the position, since due to the complexity of the Department and its myriad of programs, the issues that are escalated are diverse in nature and can require solutions that are very specific to each situation. These issues require that the Director have wide ranging knowledge of the Department and its programs and services, as well as the payments due Canadians and employees, to be able to address complex issues in a timely manner. The Director represents ESDC on PSPC committees dealing with the stabilization of the Phoenix pay system. The Director is a member of the Branch Management Committee chaired by the Director General, and regularly makes presentations to committees chaired by the CFO.

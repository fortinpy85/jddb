This position has influence over major Projects related to the mandate of the Operations Bureau, in support of Branch executives and managers both in the Central Region and across the other Regions as weil as other initiatives
related to the development of operational policies and strategic frameworks for Passport Operations. NATURE AND SCOPE Passport Canada operates as a Special Operating Agency (SOA) through an MOU with the Deputy Minster, Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), which has statutory responsibility for ensuring Canadian citizens, and other eligible residents of Canada, receive internationally respected travel documents. As an SOA, Passport Canada (PPTC) operates with considerably more administrative autonomy and latitude for policy development, programy/service delivery, planning and management than is found in typical government departments. PPTC is mandated to issue, revoke, withhold, recover and ensure the appropriate use of Canadian Passports and other official travel documents; provide functional guidance to Posts Abroad with respect to issuing passports; and to administer all matters relating to official Canadian travel documents. It is a self-sustaining, revenue generating agency, operating on a fuli cost recovery basis. It issues travel documents yearly through an expanding network of 33 regional offices across Canada, in addition to the Service Canada network, and partnering agreements with federal, provincial and territorial government agencies. The agency faces unprecedented growth in the volume, complexity and sensitivity of passport applications. With the ongoing pace of change in the world-wide security environment, and the additional pressures from changes initiated by American authorities, PPTC has had to respond to massive increases in the demands for passports, while maintaining its accountability for zero-risk security. It delivers approximately 2O,OOO transactions each working day, whether this involves processing a passport application or responding to an inquiry (by phone, e-mail, web site or in person). In 2OO2-2OO3, PPTC issued approximately 2.2 million secure travel documents. In 2OO7, those figures have almost doubled. With this growth comes a corresponding challenge; to provide rapid and cost-effective service delivery, while maintaining a transparent and zero-risk process. The Director, Strategic Operations provides the focal point within PPTC for: the development of strategic plans, forecasting models and operational solutions, to enhance senior management s planning capacity with respect to recruiting, staffing, training, evaluation, operational coordination, infrastructure and technological investment, partnership development, quality services, marketing, quality services, and risk management. Given the internal and external factors that contribute to the complex operational environment of Passport Canada, strong central direction is required and expected from the Operations Branch to: ensure policy coherence across all business lines; oversee the development and phased roll- out of the E-Passport; provide functional oversight for regional operations; ensure the coordinated delivery of the full complement of operational support services required for effective, efficient decision-making and case management through all business lines. The Director faces an immediate challenge in building the overall organization, culture, vision and strategy for the new organization. This broad mandate includes: developing the Branch s goals and operational strategies, and managing key relationships within the Bureau and the
... as a member of the management team. The Director will undertake the full scope of accountabilities and roles with respect to Branch coordination, linkages to corporate planning and reporting, strategic and operational planning, sound financial management, Ministerial briefings and support, etc. The Director is responsible for: developing and implementing strategic and business plans and policy, procedural and service delivery frameworks, contributing to national plans and frameworks; and providing authoritative advice on corporate initiatives. The Director must organize and structure her/his mandate in such a way as to anticipate and proactively address evolving PPTC operational needs and priorities, and develop and maintain appropriate strategic and operational linkages with the other Divisions within Passport Canada. in this capacity, the Director fulfills a dual role as expert strategist and planner, and as the principal advisor to the Chief Operating Officer and to corporate and regional executives on the development and implementation of all business reform and streamlining initiatives. The Director institutes a national, multi-faceted quality assurance/performance measurement framework to monitor operations, assess evolving needs, and evaluate operational and administrative performance (e.g., standardized systems, practices and processes, accountability architecture). One of the many challenges faced by the Director is to ensure that equitable operational support services are provided to all Divisions and regional offices and to ensure the implementation of homogeneous and compatible business practices and the integration of successful quality and consistency measures across all business lines. With the enactment of the foreseen IO years e- passport, recent focus has been on addressing strategic business concerns, issues and opportunities and aligning the operational policies, processes and practices of the PPTC to meet the new IO years e-passport requirements. The Director is responsible for developing a set of policies, directives and standards to guide the national implementation of new passport technologies to streamline the application process. This involves developing long-term (3 5 year) planning frameworks to ensure continued achievement of balancing service and security principles, and for ensuring their ongoing linkages with other departments (DFAIT) and international parties. Given the scope and potential impact of the position s role, planning must encompass not only the technical and business process models, but mission-critical security elements. At the same time, the Director plans and leads the related consultation and communications strategics required to promote understanding and acceptance of new approaches on the part of stakeholders in Canada and abroad. The Director, Strategic Operations provides the linkage between the development of PPTC s strategic vision and the operationa! and technological realities or passport production, and the macro-level issues of governance, systems architectures, and IM/IT requirements. The Director must respond to a number of managerial, technical and communications challenges in reconciling the divergent views of other PPTC branches and partners (e.g., receiving agents in the public and private sectors, and Service Canada). The Director leads investigation into which common technology platforms and applications can best support Passport Canada s future requirements, to ensure seamless, sustainable, and cost-effective service delivery. The Director
will contimue to conceive, develop and test innovations which will benefit the agency and its partner organizations, and to monitor the effectiveness of these innovations from the operational perspective. The Director must ensure that all potential business re-engineering initiatives are consistent with the long-term vision of the Agency and its established service delivery standards. The incumbent also monitors operational systems and programs at the national level and advises the Chief Operating Officer on potential efficiencies. This role is critical to maintaining the quality standards and levels of service expected by all stakeholders. The Director contributes to the Agency s policy coherence, and provides a critical role in ensuring that the operational policies developed in the Regions are consistent with those of the national policy framework for enterprise-wide service delivery. Therefore, while the work incorporates all the managerial and technical challenges of optimizing the future of service delivery in a national context, the Director must also understand, interpret and respond to the policy implications of regional developments. This overview also assists the incumbent in contributing to the day-to-day operational management of the organization, through strategic and authoritative advice to the Chief Operating Officer. The Director is the lead in the Operations Branch on strategic and tactical issues that has cross- Branch implications.

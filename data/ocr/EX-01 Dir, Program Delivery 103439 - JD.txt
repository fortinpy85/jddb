NATURE AND SCOPE The Learning Branch was formed due to the significant emphasis placed on leaming and investment in Learning for the future in the 2OO4 Speech from the Throne and 2OO4 and 2OO5 Budgets. It is responsible for: a wide range of programs (including Canada Student Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program, Adult Learning and Literacy Programs); changes to programs in the short and the medium-term to support lifelong learning and literacy; negotiating, implementing and ensuring the ongoing enhancement of new service provision arrangements; implementing strong corporate governance frameworks and control over both its Grants and Contributions and Statutory programs; establishing and sustaining proactive consultation, knowledge and information networks and processes with domestic, foreign and international partners and stakeholders; and providing strategic advice and briefings to the ADM, DM and Minasters. The CLSP dates back to I964. Three major loan regimes marked its development: from I964 to I994, it was a statutory program, under the Canada Students Loans Act, offering guaranteed loans; in I994, the Canada Students Financial Assistance Act was enacted and risk-shared loans replaced guaranteed loans; and since 2OOO, it has provided direct loans in collaboration with the provinces and terntories. This evolution has created a formidable challenge in the management of loans that have been granted under three different regimes, two different Acts and have been administrated by banks or federal- provincial/territorial organisations. Retracing the story of any given file Is an arduous and complex endeavour. The CSLP Is a vital component of the Government's Skills and Learning Agenda to enable Canadians to learn, acquire skills and participate fully in the civic, social and economic life of the 2I" century. The Program mandate Is enacted in legislation and Cabinet-approved program policy. Its mission is to promote accessibility to post-secondary education (PSE) for qualified students through the provision of regular/part-time loans to lessen their financial hardship, and to ensure Canadians have an opportunity to develop the skills to fully participate in a knowledge-based economy and society. The CSLP Directorate is responsible for the governance of the Program, planning, organizing and allocating available human, financial and material resources to realize the strategic objectives, goals and pnorities of the Program within the objectives and broader context of the Branch, HRSIDC and the federal government. The Directorate is a major component of the Learning Branch, covering a wide range of program areas that have a direct impact on students enrolled in universities, colleges, in vocational schools and other related programs, on HRSDC finance, and on the life of younger and increasingly adult Canadians. Given the expansion of the CSLP, its significantly increased complexity and its importance within government and high profile with Canadians and the media, a business model for the division of Cooper Consulting 3/28/O6
Director, Program Delivery, CSLP Page 3 of 5 w accountabilities and responsibilities between the DG and the Senior Director was designed based on an analysis of best practices and lessons learned in the public service in managing complex programs which require decision-making in multiple and diverse areas of expertise, and where the addition of individual talents working collaboratively contribute to effective and consistent corporate leadership. In this business model, the Senior Director has delegated responsibility for the day-to-day internal management of the Directorate and its program Divisions for all service delivery issues and activities, including coordinating all Directorate horizontal business processes (including business/resource planning; performance measurement; risk assessment; service delivery and resource, operational policy and research, monitoring, evaluation and reporting; Ministerial Correspondence; Internal Communications; and CSL System operations and maintenance), facilitating process enhancement and reengineering, and managing change. Within this context, the Director Is responsible for the operational program delivery and effective resource allocation of loans under all three loan regimes. The Director must effectively manage a number of relationships on behalf of the CSLP, as the operational interface with the Service Providers, several OGDs and the provinces/territories. These objectives are achieved through three spheres of activity: federal/provincial relations; operations and systems; and a comptroller function. The Director works to improve the administration of the loan program through relationships with the provinces and territories. Provincial/termtoral governments have primary jurisdiction for PSE under this shared public policy portfolio (6O% - 4O%) which require shared operational activities, such as tracking and closely monitoring files, ensuring follow-through and reconstituting file histories. The Director is responsible for negotiating and implementing all operational activities that have to be integrated, including harmonized collections between the federal and provincial governments. Although four provinces currently have integration agreements with the federal government, the Director is expected to keep all provinces/territories informed on CSLP issues that have an impact on their jurisdiction including the issuance of weekly lists of student borrowers who are restricted from receiving further Canada Student Loans to all provinces/termitories so they can make necessary changes in their systems, audit progress and results are shared to improve administrative/system processes and loan repayments. Once provinces/terntorics have approved loan applications received from students, Service Providers carry out many of the administrative tasks associated with loan payment and repayment. The Director Is responsible for the ongoing maintenance of obligations set out in contractual arrangements with the Service Providers, and works collaboratively in developing and implementing a client-centric service strategy to ensure objectives can be met. The Division develops procedures for Service Providers and guidelines for financial institutions to follow, and designs and delivers training in the use of loan systems and enhancements. While the development and maintenance of loan systems are the responsibility of corporate systems, the business processes require significant enhancement and re-engineering as a result of the changing external environment, as well as client expectations and requirements. The Director provides leadership through the massive change process, encouraging the development and enhancement of loan systems while ensuring the system will be forward thinking in use of technological assurance of good govemance and reporting, and in the provision of information and services to the client. The Director is expected to work in close collaboration and consultation with other Divisions in CSLP to maximize knowledge and innovation, and incorporate best practices of clicnt-centric decision-making. Enhancements must meet existing requirements as well as new provisions in service provider contractual arrangements, while ensuring integrity, storage, retrieval and accuracy of loans data. The rapid evolution of client needs and changes to the loan regimes present a major challenge for the Director. The incumbent must adjust plans and services provided in order to ensure that the new and existing legacy loan systems needs are met ina timely, efficient and cost effective manner.

The Director is responsible for the program and grants reporting in the DRR, ARLU and DPP, and is expected to manage and reduce the incidence of bad debts, collections and default loans through a rigorous comptroller function for the CSLP. The Division processes payments to the Service Providers tor contractual obligations, for issuing invoices to provinces/territories, and for payments for statutory claims, such as interest relief claims from financial institutions. Data integrity is monitored and verified, and manual changes are inputted into the CSL system. Other comptrollership functions vary depending on the loan regime: under the risk-shared regime for example, once per year financial institutions can submit up to 3% of their outstanding loans which are bought back by the CSIP and then submitted for collection. The Director ensures that audit observations are implemented and effective in addressing problem areas. It Is the Director's responsibility to identify opportunities to enhance business processes for the processing of existing and guaranteed loans, and interfacing to risk-shared and direct loans processed by Service Providers. The Director is expected to maximize and build on information gathered during consultations and negotiations with corporate systems, with service providers, and with other stakeholders such as the Provinces and educational institutions, in addition to cross-functional interfaces with CSIP Divisions. The Director Is a member of the CSLP Management Committee that determines policy, direction, priorities of the CSLP. The Director must ensure that the full expertise of the work units Is tapped, increasing the overall collective capacity and managing resources prudently.

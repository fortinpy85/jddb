NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. The Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD) develops social policies and designs programs to ensure that children, families, seniors, persons with disabilities, the homeless and those at risk of homelessness, communities and others who are facing social challenges have what they need to maintain their well-being and facilitate their participation in Canadian society. ISSD works to build the Canada-wide early learning and child care system, ensures that eligible Canadians are provided with retirement, survivor and disability benefits, supports the long-term financial security of persons with disabilities, implements accessibility legislation and invests in the capacity of organizations and the non-profit sector to reduce 2
barriers and promote access to opportunities for vulnerable populations. The major programs managed by the Branch are Early Learning and Child Care, Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care, the Old Age Security (OAS) program, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the Canada Pension Plan disability (CPPD) benefit and the Canada Disability Savings Program (CDSP). With the 2O2O Fall Economic Statement, the Government of Canada announced the creation of a new Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care (the Secretariat) to support the design and implementation of a Canada-wide system of ELCC. Situated within ESDC, the Secretariat negotiates and manages the federal bilateral ELCC_ agreements with provinces and territories; conducts ELCC data and research projects; and provides funding to further innovation and increase access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive ELCC programs and services in Canada. The Secretariat also provides secretariat support services to the National Advisory Council on ELCC, and the FPT Forum of Ministers Most Responsible for ELCC and its governance structure comprising a DM Senior Officials table and FPT Working Group. It also ensures close coordination with the ESDC Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Secretariat on inter-related areas of policy development. Within this context, the Director, Strategic Policy & Issues Management serves as the lead for strategic policy, quantitative analysis, strategic horizontal policy coordination and the management of issues arising from the policy, communications, and programmatic work related to creating, implementing, and expanding the Canada-wide ELCC system. As the designated strategic policy lead for the Federal Secretariat on ELCC, the Director sets the strategic focus guiding the collaborative work of the Secretariat with the other divisions within the Federal Secretariat, the Indigenous ELCC Secretariat, other ESDC branches, other federal departments, the provinces and territories, community leaders, and other stakeholders to prioritize actions and responses and deliver policy and program initiatives to increase access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive early learning and child care in Canada. Significant consultation is also carried out with the Privy Council Office, Finance Canada, Treasury Board Secretariat, and other key stakeholders in examining the potential impacts of proposed policy and program initiatives in terms of alleviating the shortage of child care spaces, and increasing affordability, quality and inclusivity of ELCC programs across the country. In addition, the Director directs the quantitative and qualitative analysis and data modelling supporting development of ELCC policy and program initiatives and the negotiation of bilateral agreements between the federal and provincial/territorial governments. This includes cost modelling supporting evidence-based decision-making with respect to the creation, implementation, and expansion of the Canada-wide ELCC system. The Director is regularly called to provide briefings to ESDC senior officials on the strategic advice on the immediate and broader implications of the proposed policy and programmatic initiatives related to the creation, implementation, and expansion of the Canada-wide ELCC system. The incumbent also directs the preparation of Cabinet and the Treasury Board submissions in support of proposed ELCC policy and program initiatives; provides strategic policy support for the ELCC Mid-Term-Planning and budgeting processes; provides policy support to the National Advisory Council on ELCC; and develops the overarching strategic policy framework and vision guiding ELCC policy and program development and federal decisions to invest in ELCC partnerships and strategic initiatives. Under the Director's leadership, the division also serves as the focal point for the preparation of a wide range of high-level ELCC policy documents, Question Period cards, responses to ATIP 3
requests, national progress reports and communications products, including content created for web publishing and official announcements highlighting FPT agreements and ELCC initiatives. In terms of monitoring and reporting progress in relation to the federal government's strategic ELCC priorities, the Director ensures continuing alignment of proposed ELCC initiatives/agreements with the overarching federal vision for a Canada-wide ELCC system; ensures priority issues relating to such matters as increasing child care spaces, potentially expanding the Canada-wide ELCC system, improving inclusivity in child care, and addressing issues affecting the ELCC workforce and others remain a strategic priority focus. In working with the various government and non-government ELCC stakeholders, the Director is expected to provide horizontal strategic policy advice and leadership; to harmonize the differing priorities and interests of the various ELCC stakeholder interests; to lead the consultative work within the Secretariat, the Department, and in partnership with other divisions in the ELCC Secretariat, inter-governmentally and with ELCC stakeholders more broadly, to define a strategic vision for continuous improvement of the ELCC system; and to formulate strategic policy advice and recommendations that ultimately influence federal priorities and strategic investments in the ELCC system. Major challenges for the Director include the urgency of the issues surrounding ELCC, particularly the shortage of affordable, high-quality child care spaces, labour shortages in the ELCC workforce, macroeconomic trends and issues, and the resultant impacts on the Canadian economy and families across the country. As the designated strategic policy lead, the Director plays a key strategic leadership role in first establishing the overarching strategic policy frameworks supporting the negotiation and implementation of bilateral agreements and through these, the delivery of federal investments supporting the ELCC needs and priorities of families and stakeholders across Canada. Other challenges are faced in responding to emerging child care crises/issues affecting families in Canada and the ELCC workforce such as the temporary relief payments provided to assist families and members of the ELCC workforce during the global COVID-I9 pandemic. Such issues can have far-reaching long-term social and economic consequences and thus are of the highest priority for the Department and the Government of Canada.

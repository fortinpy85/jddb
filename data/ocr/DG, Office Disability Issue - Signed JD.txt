NATURE AND SCOPE The Department of Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) is committed to building a stronger and more competitive Canada by enabling Canadians to make choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives. ESDC develops policies that make Canada a society in which all can participate and that ensures that all Canadians can use their talents, skills and resources to thrive in the competitive market and contribute to their well-being. It creates programs and support initiatives that help Canadians invest in themselves to move through life s transitions: from families with children to seniors, from school to work, from one job to another, from unemployment to employment, from the workforce to retirement. The Income Security and Social Development Branch of the Department is the focal point for social policy and programs designed to ensure that children, families, seniors, people with disabilities, the homeless and those at risk of homelessness, communities and others who are facing social chalienges have the support, knowledge, and information they need to maintain their well-being and facilitate their participation in society. Close to I5% of Canadians reported having a disability in 2OO6. The perception of the disabled community is that progress is slow on this file and that there is an apparent lack of political will to address the collective social development needs of the client group. Over time, stakeholders have built a relationship with the Minister and the Department, and individuals regularly request the intervention of the Minister and the Prime Minister in their cases. Issues are framed on the principles of human rights and advocacy. It is critical that issues be anticipated and managed carefully and sensitively, and that the Department continually solicit the involvement of national and regional organizations and individuals hear their stories, engage them in open dialogue, take transparent action on program development and evaluation, and maintain strong communications links. Within the Income Security and Social Development Branch, the Office for Disability Issues (ODI) is the focal point within the Department and the Government of Canada for key partners working to promote the full inclusion and participation of Canadians with disabilities in all aspects of society and community life. The Office works to be a dynamic, value-added centre of expertise and focal point on disability issues by stakeholders and provincialiterritorial governments. It engages partner's regularly on program and policy development and generates and shares knowledge widely, and delivers programs within its responsibility. ODI strives to provide leadership and foster excellence for the Government of Canada in this area of shared responsibilities. The Office must deliver on Government priorities to: enhance social innovation; create greater synergies among partners and stakeholders and leverage maximum benefits from partners pooled contributions; improve service delivery; and increase the engagement of, and ODI responsiveness to, the interests of clients, stakeholders and partners. An additional complexity is the need for strengthened accountability, and enhanced value-for-money and returns on federal investments. In this context, the Director General, Office for Disability Issues is accountable for: (i) raising the capacity and commitment of federal departments to take disability issues into account in developing policies, programs and services; (ii) building the capacity of the voluntary sector and creating cohesive networks of partners through strategic investments; (iii) supporting the ongoing pursuit and dissemination of knowledge to inform policy and program development; and, (iv) Director General, Office for Disability issues
CO daching out to engage Canadians on disability issues, increase awareness, and build citizen consensus regarding full participation of people with disabilities in society. The Minister is the lead federal minister responsible for the Government of Canada s disability agenda and for the promotion of equitable participation for people with disabilities. Given this role, the Director General is challenged with making OD! and ESDC a model of excellence in the treatment and integration of people with disabilities in the workplace in order to enhance the Department's credibility with all levels of government and with external clients, stakeholders and partners at the domestic and international levels. The Director General contributes to the development of a departmental research agenda, intended to provide the Department's executive and key external clients and partners with an understanding of the factors driving policy and program change with respect to peopie with disabilities. The Director General fosters the development of a research agenda that effectively targets evolving needs, and is adjusted and realigned as needed to ensure its ongoing relevance in a changing environment. The Director General provides leadership in building the ODI analytical capacity and tools. The incumbent manages linkages among departmental and external partners, and ensures the use of multiple lines of inquiry to advance sound policy analysis and identify knowledge gaps. This requires extensive knowledge and appreciation of a wide range of economic and social factors that impact on people with disabilities, the policy goals and objectives of other federal and provincial/territorial stakeholders and a thorough understanding of the interests and objectives of the clientele being served. The incumbent must also be intimately familiar with domestic and international trends and how they separately and collectively impact on the social and economic outcomes of people with disabilities. The Director General establishes and manages partnerships and networks with HRSDC's branches, particularly the Program Operations Branch which is accountable for delivering the bulk of the ODI Grant and Contribution programs, and regions and with the offices of the DM and the Minister. These are essential to solicit their input and to develop strategies, program policies, service delivery, performance measurement and accountability frameworks, and coordinate their national, regional and local/community implementation. A key challenge for the incumbent in developing these frameworks is to assess their cost-effectiveness, affordability, and capacity to provide acceptable service levels to people with disabilities while not placing unrealistic future program and financial stresses on the Department. These partnerships and networks also enable the Director General to promote and advocate ODI priorities and objectives across the Department and to lead and collaborate in innovative domestic initiatives (e.g., LMAPDs, Disability Data Strategy, CNIB Library initiative, Mental Health Commission of Canada initiative) and international initiatives (e.g., the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities). In addition, these networks facilitate the development of national plans in response to objectives and priorities stemming from major policy reviews and Cabinet decisions. The Director General oversees the development of extensive briefing notes for the DMs and the Ministers, and directs the preparation of submissions to central agencies, Memoranda to Cabinet and legislative submissions for approval in Parliament related to new and amended ODI program policy and delivery initiatives. The incumbent advises ESDC corporate branches and regions, OGDs, the provinces/territories and other partners on program and service delivery changes necessary to address new initiatives and resolve high-profile, sensitive disability issues. Director General, Office for Disability issues
CYiven ODI's recognised expertise and capacity, the incumbent directs the provision of secretariat services to major intra and inter-departmental and intergovernmental meetings and conferences involving the disability portfolio. The Director General ensures optimal horizontal coordination among federal and provincial/territorial departments and the active involvement of all stakeholders and partners in the national disability issues portfolio. This is achieved by overseeing extensive, transparent consultations with clients, central agencies, OGDs, NGOs, and other public, private and voluntary sector and community organizations. The incumbent must also have highly developed communication skills and political acumen to conduct extensive negotiations, representational and public awareness activities with partners and stakeholders to secure agreement for and engagement in new program, policy and service delivery initiatives. The Director General oversees the planning, development, and evaluation of a number of grant and contribution funding programs, including: the disability component of the Government's Social Development Partnerships Program; the Enabling Accessibility Fund; and the Registered Disability Savings Plan. The Director General ensures the development and coordinated implementation of comprehensive program policies and standards, as well as regulations and management frameworks to ensure sound program governance, accountability and integrity. The incumbent supports colleagues who have direct responsibility for the robust assessment, due diligence and approval processes with a view to ensuring program outcomes are aligned with the vision, priorities and objectives of the Minister and the Government. The Director General directs the monitoring and evaluation of Program and transfer payment policies and standards to ensure compliance, accountability and integrity. In addition, the incumbent ensures ODI compliance with departmental, ministerial and parliamentary obligations for reporting on performance and results. This is particularly challenging for the Director General as the Program Operations Branch delivers much of the ODI G&C programming. The responsibility for program policy and program oversight (including overall accountability) rests with the incumbent who must ensure program policy is consistent with the department's G&C modernization agenda led by POB and prevailing G&C management practices in POB, and for ensuring close co-ordination between the two branches with respect to program operations and communications. . Adding to the complexity is the need to ensure that program policy and operations are consistent with the Department's social Partnerships agenda led by SPRB. Accordingly, the incumbent is also accountable for providing national corporate leadership for the delivery of pilot projects in line with the social partnerships agenda under the Social Development Partnerships Program and the Enabling Accessibility Fund. The Director General is a member of the Branch Management Team and, as such, contributes to the formulation of the Branch s culture, philosophy, strategic, business and operational priorities, and overarching program policy and delivery, performance measurement and accountability frameworks. The incumbent contributes to developing and maintaining a professional and supportive work environment in the Branch that encourages empowerment and the continuous development of managers and staff and provides opportunities for growth. The incumbent manages Directorate human and financial resources to attain the strategic priorities of HRSDC's Vision statement and of senior management, and to optimize departmental investments with respect to disability issues.

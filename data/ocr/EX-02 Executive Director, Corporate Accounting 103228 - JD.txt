With a workforce of over 47,OOO, located in some 6OO locations across Canada, ESDC is adopting world class service delivery models enabled by modern technologies to provide more services online and deliver services in a way that responds to clients current and emerging needs.

The Executive Director is responsible for the financial reporting and accounting of the department, which includes 4 sets of financial statements, (Departmental and separately audited financial statements for the Consolidated Canada Pension Plan, the Employment Insurance Operating Account, and the Government Annuities Account) and the audited Public Accounts of ESDC; these financial statements account for 39% of total Government of Canada s planned expenditures. The CPP Consolidated Financial Statements are not consolidated into the Government of Canada s Financial reporting, as they are jointly controlled by the provincial and federal financial ministers. They are consolidated with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) a crown corporation, and represent almost $6OO billion in net assets, for which the Senior Director is responsible to ensure quarterly and year end reporting to the various provincial and Federal finance ministers meets all reporting requirements and works with Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to ensure the sustainability of the fund meets legislative requirements. The Executive Director is responsible for determining the departmental position on the financial reporting in the government of Canada financial statements and public accounts. The Executive Director is responsible to advocate and defend the accounting practices, positions and frameworks for the departmental reporting as well as providing authoritative advice and representing the department's priorities and ESDC 's unique portfolio to Central Agencies and the Office of the Auditor General, without which the government of Canada would not receive a clean audit opinion, and subsequently would directly impact the credit rating for the Government of Canada. The Executive Director is also responsible for the interpretation and establishment of accounting policies that directly influence and impact the Department of Finance's fiscal framework for the Government of Canada, meaning the overall budget and expenditure management, and financial position of the government of Canada.

guidelines, and on establishing strong financial and procedural controls throughout the execution of the departmental programs, grants and contributions, programs administered on behalf of other government departments, as well as those that are administered on ESDC s behalf by other government departments. This is a major challenge for the Executive Director given the wide variety and complexity of ESDC s programs, and the lack of best practices give the uniqueness of ESDC s portfolio.

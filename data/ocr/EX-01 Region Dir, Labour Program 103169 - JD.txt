NATURE AND SCOPE: HRDC- Labour administers the Canada Labour Code covering the labour standards, occupational health and safety, industrial relations for private sector industries under federal jurisdiction, including transpiration, communication, banking, grain handling, ports, nuclear fuel cycle industries, and Part IV for the Public Service. The work environment has become increasingly complex and sensitive over the past several years. Occupational Safety and Health has assumed a much higher profile due to such factors as increased attention to accident prevention, joint safety responsibilities, the short and long-term effects on health of hazardous substances including chemicals, dust
/ . rN @ and asbestos, and the psychological effects of new technologies. Over the same period employment conditions and employee relations have assumed new importance as a result of increased understanding by employees of their rights and entitlements, and the corresponding responsibility of employers for equitable treatment. As a consequence, standards legislation has become much broader in scope dealing with matters such as unjust dismissal and harassment in addition to the traditional hours of work and wage concepts. These changes have resulted in the requirement of new techniques for dealing with issues in which the emphasis has tended to swing away from relying only upon regulation and control in a policing sense, to one which includes persuasion and cooperation to voluntarily meet the legislated requirements. These changes have also contributed to the adoption of new non-legislated programs based on education and cooperation as exemplified by the Labour Education Program. This environment governs some II,OOO work sites in the Region, represented by several different employee groups such as: Teamsters Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Communications and Electrical Workers of Canada (CEWC) Canadian Brotherhood of Railway, Transport and General Workers .

In the process of coordinating the various aspects of programs, the Regional Director must consider outside factors such as Provincial - Industrial policies, economic concems, changing institutional features of Canada s industrial system, public awareness and demands, etc. These factors are having a considerable
\ impact on the analytical and empirical methodologies implemented to define the appropriate response to the oft-times complicated and urgent requests for assistance from the Department.

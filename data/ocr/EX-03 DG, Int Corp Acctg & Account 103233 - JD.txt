Nature and Scope Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the Department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. It is one of the largest and most complex federal departments. It employs over 24,OOO people and its activities account for almost one out of every three dollars spent by the federal government. The ESDC Portfolio (encompassing the Department, Labour Program and Service Canada) operates within a highly matrixed governance structure and operating model, supporting four Ministers (i.e. Minister of Families, Children and Social Development: Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour; Minister of Public Services, Procurement and Accessibility; and Minister of Seniors). Portfolio organizations operate with five (5) distinct sources of funding the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Employment Insurance Operating Account, the Canada Pension Base Account, the Canada Pension Additional Account, and the Passport Revolving Fund, and deliver a large number of diverse programs to Canadians. Overall Portfolio expenditures are projected to be $I38.3 Billion in FY 2OI9-2O. ESDC has a broad mandate that includes social policies and programs, including Labour, and the delivery of a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives. For example, the Department provides seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education, and assists parents who are taising young children. The Labour Program contributes to social and economic well-being by fostering safe, healthy, fair and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the federal jurisdiction. Service Canada helps citizens access ESDC s programs, as well as other Government of Canada programs and services. Additionally, ESDC now has legislative authority to deliver services on behalf of other organizations and must therefore recover costs for these activities, which adds additional complexity to service delivery operations. ESDC is both a policy and a service organization. As a policy department it plays a significant role in the Government's policy agenda which supports delivery of a number of programs, including over 4O statutory grants and contributions programs. The Policy Branch of ESDC is responsible for the policies of all 4O programs delivered by the Department. These programs include CPP, Employment Insurance, and OAS, as well in excess of 4O Grants and Contributions programs. The Policy Branch has 5 separate sub-branches each with its own area of specialty. These are the Strategy and Service Policy Branch, the Skills and Employment Branch (SEB), the Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD), the Labour Program Branch, and the Learning Branch, with total FTEs in excess of 26OO employees. DG, Int Corporate Acctg Account Page 4 of IO April I, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada As a service organization", ESDC reaches virtually every Canadian through over 58O of Service Canada's points of service across the country, by phone, in person, or on-line through the canada.ca website. Service Canada, which began operations in late 2OO5 with a mandate to provide Canadians with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits, accounts for the majority of operating results of the Department, employing approximately I7,OOO employees across Canada. Through Service Canada, the Department is responsible for delivering over $I2O Billion in benefits directly to individuals and organizations through such Government of Canada programs and services, such as Employment Insurance, Old Age Security, the Canada Pension Plan, Passport Receiving Agent Services, the Social Insurance Number, and the Canada Student Loans Program. The Department also provides $4.8 Billion in funding to other levels of government, educators and organizations in the voluntary and private sectors. Service Canada is currently undergoing significant change to its operations due to modernization efforts, the greater number of grants and contributions programs, and increased responsibilities in the realm of service delivery. Significant large scale projects include the closing of 34 Passport Canada Offices across the country and the incorporation of Passport Canada services in the Service Canada sites. Another project involves modernizing Canada s legacy benefit payments system, and recently ESDC has enacted legislation that enables Service Canada to deliver services for partners (OGDs and external organizations) with ensuing cost recovery agreements. This transition and the subsequent increase in complexity necessitates the evaluation and reoptimization of existing service strategies and plans, as well as financial management processes to accommodate this scale up in responsibility, while maintaining a high service standard and prudent financial stewardship. The ICAAD Directorate of the CFO Branch is responsible for ensuring adherence to general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in all of ESDC s national accounts payable and receivable operations, grants and contributions, and accounting operations, as well as the development of departmental financial policies and internal control frameworks, and associated processes and procedures. Within this highly complex environment, the Director General, Integrated Corporate Accounting and Accountability Directorate and Deputy CFO, establishes the Directorate as the national leader for all of ESDC on the sound stewardship of the Department's financial operations and establishes the vision, goals and objectives for its debt management, national accounts receivable, national accounts payable, corporate accounting, financial policy and internal control, grants and contributions, and proactive disclosure and relocation functions. The Director General provides corporate leadership and vision for the development, promotion and implementation of a modern comptrollership philosophy and a Financial Management Framework that integrate risk management and analysis, financial analysis, Corporate Financial Reporting, and internal controls, and that meet the test of both internal and external audit. The Director General ensures that all ESDC programs and associated payments adhere to central agency requirements and guidelines for all of their financial operations and transactions, to ensure accountability and transparency. The Director General develops and maintains high level contacts and represents the Department with senior officials at the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), Office of the Comptroller General (OCG), Office of the Auditor General (OAG) on stewardship issues pertaining to all areas of responsibility. The financial operations of ESDC are extremely complex within the Public Service. They constantly face high financial risk due to the nature and visibility of its programs, the complexity of its funding authorities, its clientele and broad geographic distribution, and high level of oversight by Parliament, the Auditor General and TBS. The risks and consequences of error are very high. DG, Int Corporate Acctg Account Page S of IO April I, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada The Director General is accountable for managing numerous complex relationships at the senior executive level in the Department to resolve complex issues, such as emergency payments to Canadians, the incorporation of payments for new or changed social programs, major changes to policies and processes required due to audit recommendations, the resolution of issues related to the development of four sets of financial statements so they can be signed off by the Office of the Auditor General, and sensitive debt recovery issues. The Director General collaborates with other senior departmental executives to ensure the Directorate is viewed as a strategic partner by departmental line managers in delivery of their mandates, and leads capacity-building within the Directorate to ensure all financial operations are timely and can withstand audit. The Director General provides strategic leadership to ensure the prudence and probity of the Department's financial operations, including debt management, corporate accounting and reporting, management of payables and receivables, and proactive disclosure, in order to support and meet legislative requirements, government-wide financial management directives, and departmental programs, operational needs and strategic business goals. The Director General ensures that all ESDC financial operations take into account the current operational context of both the government and the Department. The Director General cultivates contacts at the most senior levels to ensure alignment with other government departments, the central agencies and stakeholders across the country. The Director General also ensures that approaches are compliant with stewardship obligations and that all financial operations maintain the highest standards of financial accountability and transparency. The Director General provides leadership to ensure that all financial operations meet the strict standards of auditors and allow for the exercise of the Directorate s responsibilities in a transparent and open way that ensures the trust of the Canadian people. The Director General provides leadership to the development of policies that underpin the financial activities of the Department. The Director General provides leadership to ensure that all of the policies that govern departmental financial operations are in line with central agency guidelines and build in strong financial controls that enable the Directorate to attest to the accuracy of financial transactions, associated records, and reports destined for senior management, the central agencies, and Parliament. The Director General also provides executive leadership to ensure that new and existing policies are modified as needed to incorporate the recommendations of auditors and further evolve the Directorate s financial management and transparency. The Director General provides executive leadership and expert guidance on complex financial issues that have been escalated by the organization. These issues are highly complex in nature and usually require coordination among numerous senior level internal and external stakeholders, to develop win-win solutions that will allow for a resolution that will satisfy all. The Director General develops and maintains collaborative relationships with senior executives of the Program Branches, the Office of the Auditor General, Office of the Comptroller General, TBS, and other stakeholders to resolve escalated issues that are not capable of being resolved at the working level of the Directorate. The Director General provides leadership to develop and implement solutions and leads negotiations on behalf of the CFO and the Department with central agencies and other organizations, such as external auditors, as appropriate to the issue at hand. The Director provides the leadership and vision to conceptualize, develop and implement the widespread rollout of new technologies across the Directorate that will improve transaction time and increase the capacity of the organization to execute and track transactions, simplify and standardize financial operations, and automate tasks to the degree possible. The Director General provides oversight to associated pilot projects to test the latest technologies in the fields of robotics, machine learning and Al, and explore ways for their implementation. The Director General champions innovation across the Directorate and the Department, and with Senior DG, Int Corporate Acctg Account Page 6 of IO April I, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada Management to both on-board and manage expectations for these new technologies, as well as to elicit feedback and resolve any issues with their rollout in a timely manner. The Director General directs the development of consolidated departmental financial statements and financial reporting for the entirety of ESDC including the Public Accounts. The Director General provides leadership to ensure that all data collected for and included in the consolidated departmental financial statements is accurate and is collected in accordance with central agency guidelines and directives, and is capable of withstanding audit. The Director General provides expert advice and guidance to the CFO, DMs, and the Ministers on the contents of the consolidated departmental financial statements and reports to address any questions or concerns they may have. The Director General provides leadership to the development and implementation of Department wide corporate accounting, monitoring and reporting policies. The Director General provides leadership to ensure that all transactions are tracked appropriately and are in line with central agency guidelines and standards, to enable the Department's programs to withstand the strictest audit. The Director General works with senior executives of all Branches of the Department to enhance accountability and ensure that monitoring and reporting systems are in place that can both provide accurate pictures of the current operational status and environment of the myriad programs the Department delivers, and also give insights into their future state. There are several challenges for the position. The first stems from the nature of the position as the senior authority in charge of the Directorate. The Directorate is responsible for execution, tracking, monitoring and reporting on many financial transactions for the Department's myriad of programs that are relied upon by millions of Canadians. While most of these transactions are fairly straightforward, there are regularly challenging circumstances and issues that cannot be resolved at the working level. This represents a challenge for the position as issues that require escalation to the Director General to find a resolution are by definition highly complex and special cases that require considerable expertise, political savvy and a solid understanding of operations, goals and objectives of the Department as a whole and its external partners to resolve. The Director General must provide leadership to integrate the priorities of the Department as well as those of partner organizations and the central agencies into solutions that address the concerns of all stakeholders. The evolution of technology provides significant opportunity to improve the financial controls and speed of processing of ESDC s financial transactions. New technology can help process more transactions quicker, reduce the workload of employees, and improve accountability and transparency across the Department. As the authority on the full range of financial operations in the Department, the Director General must provide the vision for the identification, testing, and implementation of new innovative technologies and best practices that can harness the latest advancements to improve departmental operations and accountability. This represents a challenge for the position as The Director General must develop and cultivate a considerable knowledge of the latest technology and the latest accounting principles and best practices to evolve departmental financial operations over time. The Director General must possess considerable vision to not only identify test and implement these innovations, but also to ensure their integration into Department wide operations in a seamless way that serves to enhance accountability, accuracy and transparency. The environment within which the Director General provides leadership poses huge challenges for the position. First, the extent of the work undertaken by the Directorate is broad, and the financial operations it provides to the Department, especially where accounts payable are concerned, are linked to the political agenda of the Government over which there is no control. The Government continually refines its social policy. The Director General works with the twelve DG, Int Corporate Acctg Account Page 7 of IO April I, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada program heads of the Department to advise on policies and protocols for ensuring stewardship in their program delivery, including costs, benefits and risks of various options Results are high profile with attendant high media, regional and national interest, and scrutiny in the political sphere. At The Director General level, this requires inserting a level of nimbleness in the organization while ensuring compliance with financial rules and regulations. The role of the organization in financial monitoring, reporting and transaction processing is a key component to the effective functioning of the Department. The Directorate when operating smoothly functions almost invisibly as financial transactions are processed in a seamless way. The nature of the organization makes it difficult to shine a light on the extraordinary work that employees of the Directorate perform in making sure ESDC s myriad programs can fulfill their mandates in helping Canadians. This represents a challenge for the position as The Director General must express to senior management and government officials the complexity and challenges inherent in the work to ensure that personnel get the recognition they deserve in order to facilitate employee retention and improve office morale. Making employees feel valued is a major component of maintaining and growing the corporate knowledge of the organization and is essential to its future capabilities.

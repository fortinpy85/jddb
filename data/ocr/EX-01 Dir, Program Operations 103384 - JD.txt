NATURE AND SCOPE On December I2, 2OO3, the Prime Minister announced a restructuring of government departments and Cabinet Committees. As part of this change, he created the departments of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) and Social Development Canada (SDC) by splitting the former Department of Human Resources Development Canada into two separate and distinct Organizations. The new Learning Branch was formed due to the significant emphasis placed on learning and investment in Learning for the future in the 2OO4 Speech from the Throne and 2OO4 and 2OO5 Budgets. It is responsible for: a wide range of programs (including Canada Student Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program, Learning and Literacy Programs); changes to programs in the short and the medium- term to support lifelong learning and literacy; negotiating, implementing and ensuring the ongoing enhancement of new service provision arrangements; implementing strong corporate governance frameworks and control over both its Grants and Contributions and Statutory programs; establishing and sustaining proactive consultation, knowledge and information networks and processes with domestic, foreign and international partners and stakeholders: and providing strategic advice and briefings to the ADM, DM and Ministers. Building a Canada that can succeed in the 2Ist century is a priority for the federal Government. In her annual 2OO4 Speech from the Throne, the Governor-General advocated the government s decision to help low to middle-income families receiving the national child benefit supplement to save for their children s education. A postsecondary education is imperative in today s society, and is required for 7O% of newly created jobs. Together, the Canada Learning Bond (CLB) and the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) comprise the government s CESP, which encourages and supports Canadian children in accessing an affordable postsecondary education. The CLB provides an early $5OO instalment for babies born on or after Jan. I, 2OO4 and adds $IOO a year for I5 years (up to $2,OOO) as long as the family remains eligible for the National Child Benefit. Assuming a moderate 3.5 per cent annual return, the savings will grow to $3,OOO by the time the child is I8. The CESG, introduced in I998, was created to encourage Canadians to save for their children's education. Presently, when a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) is set up on a child's behalf, the federal government adds on an additional 2O% to parental savings, to a maximum of $4OO a year, until the child turns I7. The 2OO4 Budget proposed that, beginning in 2OO5, this 2O% matching rate be doubled to 4O% for families with incomes below $35,OOO. It also proposed increasing the rate to 3O% for families with incomes between $35,OOO and $7O,OOO. These enhanced CESG rates will apply to the first $5OO contributed in a year to achild's RESP. The enhanced CESG will be available to the families of more than 4.5 million children, and is expected to cost $8O million annually. Within this context, the Director is responsible for the operational program delivery and administration of the CESP and provincial grants, and for directing the development of responsive operational policies, Cooper Consulting IO/II/O5

Program management is guided by a citizen-first vision that looks at program design and delivery from the individual citizen s perspective. The delivery and administration of the CESP must be relevant to citizens and effectively respond to their needs and expectations, and the Director is accountable for operational policy/legislative development, planning and coordination, information collection and analysis, relationships with RESP providers and Promoters/trustees, and other program operations. In order to enhance consistency and coherence of Program delivery, the Director oversees the development and implementation of optimal processes and operational frameworks that best mect the priorities and objectives of the federal government as well as the needs and expectations of individual clients and promoters/trustees. The incumbent must also operationalize and deliver on agreements with the CRA and provincial governments. The Director accomplishes these tasks through four spheres of activity: client services, learning and development, eServices, and operational policy and legislation. The Director leads the day-to-day operational delivery and administration of CESP, which includes approving and processing federal and provincial related grants and bond requests, handling appeals and adjudication, disseminating information, responding to Ministerial requests, and interpreting and enforcing regulations.

In support of client services, the Director fosters a strong legislative and Operational policy development and interpretation capacity to effectively respond to the myriad of questions related to benefits and obligations under CESP. This poses a significant challenge for the Director due to the innovative nature of the CESP and its lack of precedent and jurisprudence; there are many areas where issues/decisions need to be researched and developed to effectively deal with enquiries while conforming to legislation and balancing competing concerns from individual clients and promoters/trustees. In order to avoid the costs and time associated with resolving issues such as challenges to the current legislative framework (including access to the CESP) and the application of the program s regulations ~ through litigation in Court, the Director is accountable for the development and modification of an effective appeals process to allow individuals to raise issues and obtain a hearing and ruling prior to deciding whether they will pursuc a formal legal challenge. In addition, the Director fosters a proactive and strong operational policy Process in order to prevent appeals in future. The Director is accountable for all aspects of the CESP appeals process which includes the following: establishing a framework and operational policy guidance tools (such as jurisprudence analysis); developing proactive CESP policy and guidelines based on emerging jurisprudence and impacts of appeal decisions; deciding when and if adverse decisions for the department will be appealed to a higher level; preparing the department s position on appeals; analyzing trends and the impact of decisions on program and policy changes; supporting the appeal process through logistical activities such as Preparing appeals, providing a location for appeals and providing information to appellants; implementing operational changes arising from appeal decisions; consulting with legal services and informing other stakeholders (including senior management, other CESP Divisions, and other HRSDC branches or OGD organizations such as the CRA) when appeals set policy or program precedents. The Director is responsible for managing strong and effective relationships with RESP service providers and promoters/trustees. The Director develops and negotiates legal agreements with promoters and trustees around the administration of the CIB, CESG and provincial grants. The Director is also responsible for managing promoter enrolment and orientation, for providing relevant training, tools and manuals, and directs the provision of authoritative advisory services, which includes answering questions related to the grants component of the RESPs.

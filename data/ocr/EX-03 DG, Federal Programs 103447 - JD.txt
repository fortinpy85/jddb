NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and improving Canadians quality of life. ESDC delivers programs and services to each and every Canadian throughout their lives in a significant capacity. ESDC fulfills its mission by developing policies that ensure Canadians can use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community delivering programs that help Canadians move through life s transitions, from school to work, from one job to another, from unemployment to employment, from the workforce to retirement; providing income support to seniors, families with children and those unemployed due to job loss, illness or caregiving responsibilities; helping Canadians with distinct needs such as Indigenous people, persons with disabilities, homeless people, travelers and recent immigrants; ensuring labour relations stability by providing mediation services; promoting a fair and healthy workplace; by enforcing minimum working conditions, promoting decent work and employment equity, and fostering respect for international labour standards; and delivering programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies. The Minister of ESDC is supported by a Deputy Minister, a Deputy Head of Service Canada, and a Senior Associate Deputy Minister of ESDC. The portfolio also includes the Labour program headed by the Minister of Labour and supported by the Deputy Minister of Labour. In terms of respective accountabilities, ESDC is responsible for policy and program development, Service Canada is the delivery arm of Government programs, services and benefits and Labour Branch promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment. ESDC operates within a complex governance and accountability structure as it must support two Ministers, a Parliamentary Secretary and a Secretary of State and has complex interfaces for service delivery to Canadians. The combined ESDC, Service Canada and Labour Branch workforce exceeds 26,OOO employees located in all regions of the country, through which the programs and services of the Department, as well as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone, by mail or through the Internet.

| vd | Emploi et Employment and D veloppement social Canada Social Development Canada One of ESDC s business lines is the Labour Program. The jurisdiction of the Labour Program includes such vital industries as rail and air transportation, inter-provincial trucking, Great Lakes and international shipping, long-shoring, grain handling and all electronic modes of interprovincial and international communications. Some 955,OOO employees in the federally regulated private sector fall under this jurisdiction, as do major employers such as Air Canada, CN Rail, Bell Canada, CBC, and Canada Post Corporation, and significant labour organizations such as the Canadian Auto Workers, Canadian Union of Postal Workers and the Communication, Energy and Paper-workers Union. In addition, the federal jurisdiction includes, for occupational health and safety matters, over 2OO,OOO Federal employees covered by the Public Service Staff Relations Act for the purposes of collective bargaining. Proper delivery of programs affecting the federal jurisdiction is important as to not disrupt or impair the organization, industry or general economy. This jurisdiction encompasses I.2 million workers, $I25 Billion GDP or 9,5% direct plus large indirect given critical importance of industry sectors such as banking, transportation, telecommunication, oil and gas, federal Crown corporations, First Nations governments and enterprises, as well as the federal public service. In addition, there are nearly 4OO provincially regulated employers with approximately 6OO,OOO employees who are impacted by the Labour Program's regulatory framework such as federal contractors who are required to implement provisions of the Employment Equity Act, Pay Equity Act and the Accessible Canada Act. Due to its profile, the Labour Program has been assigned its own Minister and Deputy Minister. The goals of the Labour Program are to promote a fair, safe, healthy, stable, productive and cooperative work environment for all Canadians. This goal is achieved through the formulation, development, implementation and enforcement of legislation relating to labour law, occupational health and safety, fire prevention, labour standards, workplace equity, workers compensation, training and workplace information. The national mandate of the Branch and the diversity of industries it covers mean that decisions taken have a major impact on the formulation and implementation of Canada's workplace policies in both the public and private sectors. In addition, the Labour Program supports effective co-operative union-management relations through the mediation, conciliation and grant programs. Finally, the Labour Program has strong international and intergovernmental functions and represents Canada in multilateral, bilateral and national fora dealing with labour standards, co-operation and technical assistance. The Labour Program's Federal Programs Directorate is responsible for the overall governance, program performance, and operations of Federal Workers Compensation Services and the Workplace Equity Program. Within this context, the Director General, Federal Programs Directorate is responsible for the financial management, program design, development and implementation of timely and cost effective policies, programs and services with respect to the FWCS and the over 435,666 eligible employees and their dependants under the GECA and the administration and enforcement of the Minister of Labour's responsibilities under the Employment Equity Act (federally regulated private sector employers as well as provincially regulated contractors conducting business with the federal government). For both the FWCS and WEP programs, the Director General provides executive leadership in developing and implementing legislation, regulations, standards and policies required to ensure a modern, high performing program that delivers on legislative and regulatory obligations for employers and improves outcomes for workers and designated groups. Failure to do so, risks possible highly negative impacts on the operations of Canadian institutions and services, including the ability of injured workers to get the medical services and financial support they need to return to work in a safe and timely manner (FWCS), or the ability to meet the goals of a representative workforce for the four designated employment equity groups identified under the EEA (i.e., women, Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minorities). One of the major challenges facing the Director General is to design and articulate broad strategic directions that lead to the development of a multi-year strategic plan that addresses the key Directorate priorities and contributes to the achievement of the Labour Program's vision and long-term objectives. The Director General is called upon to develop and implement strategies, approaches and initiatives with respect to the FWCS and WEP that address program risks and deliver results to Canadians, foster leadership, innovation, values and ethics and sound management practices. To do this, the Director General must establish and direct the research and analysis activities to assess workplace and program impacts. These responsibilities require the Director General to establish and maintain business plans, financial, data and service strategies as part of the Labour Program's strategic plan for ensuring the effectiveness, efficiency and timeliness of its delivery. The FWCS is a complex program involving management of 3O,OOO active and I4,OOO new claims each year, 4,OOO third party subrogation claims and payment of over $I9O million in compensation payments to provincial workers compensation boards and recovery of costs from departments, Crown Corporations, and agencies. Administration of the WEP involved managing employment equity programming and reporting for nearly 6OO federal employers covering 77O,OOO employees across Canada, and nearly 4OO contractors with employment equity obligations under the redesigned Federal Contractors Canada Page 3 of/de 8
| vd | Emploi et Employment and D veloppement social Canada Social Development Canada Program impacted nearly 6OO,OOO employees. In leading both the FWCS and WEP programs, the Director General ensures alignment with the Labour Program's strategic and future-oriented direction and capitalizes on opportunities for cooperation and multilateral partnerships in order to ensure timely and effective delivery and claims administration. This would include engaging in partnership with groups ranging from provincial workers compensation boards to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and Treasury Board Secretariat. The Director General leads the delivery key Labour Program services to ensure that federal government employees who have sustained work-related injuries receive timely financial, health care and rehabilitation benefits, as well as assistance to ensure early and safe return to work. Programs include the administration of the GECA, which provides compensation benefits for federal employees (including those locally engaged outside of Canada) injured in the course of their work; the administration of the MSCA, which provides compensation benefits to merchant seamen engaged in a foreign voyage or home-trade voyage; and the administration of the PSIBP on behalf of the Treasury Board Secretariat, and the compensation for death and disability in accordance with the CCRR. All of this is done in an environment where the government is introducing a number of changes to improve workplace safety and equality and protecting workers rights. This includes amendments to the Employment Equity Regulations, which introduced new pay transparency measures to raise awareness of the wage gaps experienced by women, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities in federally regulated workplaces. The Director General is responsible to promote and influence employers, to help shift business culture and expectations toward greater equality and better outcomes for workers and their families. To accomplish this, the Director General must establish the framework and direction to ensure the development and implementation of policies, procedures and directives on the application and the interpretation of the federal workers compensation legislation and regulations. The Director General must also build and maintain a solid working relationship with Treasury Board, ESDC s Chief Financial Officer Branch, provincial workers compensation boards and commissions and with internal/external consultants on the day-to-day administration of the Program. A key challenge for the Director General is the development and implementation of a modernized delivery framework to transform the delivery of services and enable digital services end-to-end. Given the scope of the transformation, the Director General requires innovative thinking to enable the delivery of these program changes to adapt to evolving environment and changing needs and requirements. The Director General must create an innovative, dynamic, engaging and inclusive work environment focused on diversity and future skills, establish capacity for collaboration and creativity to ensure both program effectiveness and support policy initiatives. The Director General responsibility for FWCS is broad legislative scope and program responsibility, including directing the monitoring and adjustments to the GECA (including LES), the MSCA, PSIBP, and the CCRR. Under this mandate, the Director General is responsible for the ongoing development and continuous renewal of overarching Directorate strategic policy and performance measurement frameworks; the management of program, policy and system development model cycles; ensuring the consistent application, modernization and enforcement of the GECA; the development of enhanced risk assessment and monitoring tools; the management of cross-cutting issues and policy areas; the management of data and program information; the development and implementation of service standards, regular monitoring and evaluation of results; the development and implementation of partnership engagement strategies and identification partnership requirements; and, the delivery of knowledge generation and product development, in order to increase data integrity and program efficiencies. In particular, the Director General leads the negotiation, management and monitoring of administrative agreements with the ten provincial workers compensation boards in order to ensure the most cost-effective and efficient service and monitoring overall program performance and governance. The Director General has an accountability for the financial administration of FWCS programs including management of GECA statutory fund (44M); accounts payable to workers compensation boards for GECA claims (over $I9OM); adjudication of LES claims; accounts receivable with federal employers; and, administration of third-party claims (in partnership with ESDC Legal Services) as well as the accounting of suspense accounts for amounts recovered and the vote net revenue fund of over $9OO,OOO. For WEP, the Director General provides leadership and direction in developing, implementing and reporting on strategies to improve representation of designated groups in federally regulated workplaces. For WEP, the Director General faces a significant challenge in advancing cost-effective, results-oriented and risk-based programs that improve outcomes for designated groups across all sectors and optimize compliance with the reporting requirements of the EEA with minimal administrative burden on employers. In addition, the Director General is responsible for directing the collection, verification and analyses of employers reporting data for the preparation of the Employment Equity Annual Report to Parliament as well as developing and delivering new programs and partnerships that facilitate employer-driven strategies to improve representation in the federally regulated private sector. The Director General also ensures support for the Minister of Labour's mandate to provide relevant labour market information products and training tools to assist employers in implementing equity in the workplace. Relationships with federal departments are key to delivering on the equity, diversity Canada Page 4 of/de 8
| vd | Emploi et Employment and D veloppement social Canada Social Development Canada and inclusion agenda including working in partnership with the Canadian Human Rights Commission and TBS, respectively, on compliance and delivery issues. As well, the Director General must foster a constructive relationship with Public Services and Procurement Canada as well Treasury Board Secretarial, which is a critical component of a well- functioning risk-based Federal Contractors Program. The Director General is responsible to develop strategies to advance program outcomes, including the delivery of enhanced Grants and Contributions program with Programs Operations Branch, annual award/recognition and stakeholder engagement. The Director General leads the development of regulatory policy (pay transparency and Canadian Forces regulations) and its implementation (program development and delivery). The Director General also leads the development and design of compliance programs, employer reporting tools, and ensure capacity for data analysis for reporting and monitoring program performance. The Director General must establish working relationships with stakeholders and create broad engagements on diversity and inclusion initiatives across GoC, including Heritage Canada for Anti-Racism, ESDC for Accessibility, Canadian Human Rights Commission for EEA and Pay Equity compliance. For both the FWCS and WEP, the Director General provides authoritative expert advice to the Assistant Deputy Minister (COPD), Deputy Minister, Minister and other senior managers to discuss and provide advice on issues related to workplace equity and federal workers compensation matters, and provides support for these responsibilities in Parliament. It is imperative for the Director General to maintain a current awareness of the government-wide priorities, horizontal and Strategic policy initiatives and the trends and development in the labour market. Akey role and challenge of the Director General's position is priority setting, including identifying and articulating strategic goals and initiatives, identifying gaps and immediate and future policy, program, and partnership needs, and building a comprehensive strategy to address those needs, which include policy integration and innovation. The Director General's role is also to promote and sustain fair and equitable workplaces within the federal jurisdiction, as well as to provide policy advice on employment equity issues while engaging employer and inter/intra-departmental networks on key initiatives related to the four designated employment equity groups. The Director General must provide strong leadership in the area of business process improvement and service modernization for FWCS and WEP through development and implementation of electronic and automated delivery systems and improved databases for the documentation and management of injury claims. To this effect, the Director General provides corporate leadership in developing and implementing strategies and approaches to orchestrate the implementation of a broad modernization agenda, the results of program and policy reviews and the need to support priorities related to accessibility and mental health. An important aspect of this agenda will include technological solutions, such as the development and implementation of the Integrated Labour System (ILS) and the development of program specific components for FWCS and WEP. The Director General is responsible for ensuring prudent financial management practices with sufficient controls to reduce program risks. The Director General directs comprehensive reviews of planned and actual expenditures throughout the life cycle of program funding to determine and implement cost/resource effectiveness, efficiency and streamlining strategies; conducts rigorous assessments of performance results against stated objectives; and directs and ensures the development and quality of the analysis and recommendations used to advise the Assistant Deputy Minister, Deputy Minister and Minister. The adoption of a whole-of-programs planning approach is therefore required to ensure that the Federal Programs linkages are integrated and aligned with Labour Program priorities. The Director General must therefore ensure the implementation of quality assurance measures for the delivery of the GECA, MSCA, PSIBP and CCRR programs through the development of sound financial management, stronger governance and accountability, monitoring and tracking data, measuring performance and ensuring an appropriate IT strategy to support the Program. The Director General is responsible for setting and leading direction and strategies for achieving and implementing Directorate and Branch level vision and priorities, including determining ways in which the quality and effectiveness of policies and program can be enhanced. To deliver on priorities, the Director General must develop a highly competent team of professional experts with the required strategic, analytical and advisory capacity, analytical expertise and create a diverse and inclusive work environment that is conducive to learning, innovation, employee involvement and commitment.

This includes establishing consultative mechanisms with program executives across the Branch and regions, as well as external engagement processes with federal employers and provincial and territorial governments and external experts, and stakeholder groups, and representing the Directorate in consultations and negotiations. The Director General plays a key role as advocate, negotiator, and representative in advancing the Directorate's strategic directions and innovation initiatives and ensuring alignment with the government's policy and program agenda and priorities. This requires strong communication, presentation, negotiation and partnership skills with the ability to successfully manage several fast-paced and intellectually complex issues and projects at any given time. The Director General establishes and sustains strong consultative and knowledge / information networks and linkages with the Ministers and DM's Offices and those of other ESDC s ADMs, and key external clients, stakeholder and partner organizations to ensure their positions and priorities are considered in the Branch s national program delivery and the resolution of major issues.

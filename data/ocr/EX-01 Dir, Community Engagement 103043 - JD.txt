Director, Partnerships The federal government policy agenda includes several major program policy and delivery challenges for Social Development Canada such as ensuring full citizenship for disabled and marginalized people in the mainstream of Canada s society and economy, building a stronger Canada through enhanced social development information and opportunities, increasing investment and policy/program effort towards key target populations (e.g., children, seniors, and people at risk), building the social development capacity of communities, individuals and other clients, stakeholders and partners to foster greater social and economic well-being and self- reliance, creating opportunities for young Canadians, and increasing investment in knowledge and creativity to facilitate the transition of individuals and communities to the knowledge-based society and economy. The Social Development Partnerships Program Is a national, centrally managed and delivered funding program that provides grants and contributions to non-profit sector organizations that are concemed with advancing the social development and inclusion needs of persons with disabilities, children and their families, and other vulnerable or excluded populations. Consistent with the federal government s support of the voluntary sector to strengthen the ability of both government and the sector to achieve their common goal of enhancing the quality of life for Canadians, the Social Development Partnerships Program works to increase the effectiveness of the non-profit sector, and to improve the quality and responsiveness of the federal government s social policies and programs by fostering partnerships, supporting knowledge development and dissemination, and strengthening organizational capacity. The Social Development Partnerships Program currently funds activities within three streams of activities: Disability, which seeks to advance the Government of Canada s Disability Agenda by promoting the full participation of Canadians with disabilities in leaming, work, and community life; Early Learning and Child Care, which seeks to advance the Government of Canada s commitment to improving the outcomes of children O-6 through the September 2OOO First Ministers Agreement on Early Childhood Development and the March 2OO3 Multilateral Framework on Early Learning and Child Care; and, Social Inclusion, which seeks to advance the Government of Canada s commitment to alleviate the conditions of social exclusion for vulnerable populations. The evolving federal government policy agenda includes several major policy and program priorities for Social Development Canada. These include removing barriers to ensure full citizenship for disabled and marginalized people in the mainstream of Canada s society and economy, building a stronger Canada through enhanced social development analysis and information and the identification and proactive leadership of responses to opportunities, increasing investment and policy/program effort towards key target populations (e.g., children, seniors, disabled, single mothers, and people at risk, or key transitions in their lives), building the social development capacity of individuals and other clients, stakeholders and partners to foster greater social and economic well-being and self-reliance for Canadians, increasing investment in knowledge, creativity and information products to facilitate the transition of individuals, communities and industries to the knowledge-based society and economy, forming partnerships and new working relationships and service delivery modalities within the Department and with 3

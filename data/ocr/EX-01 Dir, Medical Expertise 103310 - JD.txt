Cc Employment and Social Development Canada @ implement the CPP Disability program, including objectives, program policy, legislative and regulatory frameworks and accountability frameworks. The Directorate provides guidance and interpretation of CPP Disability legistation and program policy, research, and analysis of issues and identification of trends related to CPP-D. The Directorate provides medical expertise to support evolution of policy, program design, legislation consistent with up to date medical best practices in relation to disability, litigation and appeals, and authoritative, strategic advice and recommendations to departmental officials and the Minister. It is within this context that the Director Medical Expertise is accountable for planning, organizing and directing the provision of medical expertise toward three key areas: (I) The analysis of files and trends to build an evidence base. An evidence base is the essential underpinning for disability program development, and the development of evidence-based policy and program frameworks, analyses, options, guidelines, policy directions and advice. Through an evidence base, the Director can assure the integration of new scientific and clinical developments into disability determination (e.g. functional capacity assessment: information from physicians and other health professionals); provide ongoing professional development for medical adjudicators; and support the analysis of business intelligence to inform policy and program directions. (2) The introduction of medical expertise into quality assurance and continuous leaming. The Director ensures the provision of physician consultations on difficult / complex initial, reconsideration and appeals cases, including assessment of incapacity files which also arise at the appeals levels and in OAS and general CPP cases; provide medical advice and review of a structured sample of cases to promote and support consistency of decision- making on disability issues across the Program at the earliest possible stage; and, based on intelligence from these reviews, plan and provide educational sessions for medical adjudicators and program policy staff and ensure integration of findings from file reviews in policy development and tools, as applicable. (3) The provision of medical advice on as many cases as possible going to General Division where new information has been received, in order to confirm the Minister's position prior to certification (or after, in some cases), and support Appeals before the Social Security Tribunal Review. This requires coordination of staff work with Legal Services on settlements; the provision of medical expertise to Legal Services on Appeal Division cases as required; and the conduct of analytical reviews of General Division decisions to determine trends and issues to inform quality assurance and policy development.

Cc Empioyment and Social Development Canada c For many years, most of the work of the Division has been focused on case-by- case review of medical documentation and applicant data to provide medical advice and prepare the Minister's position for cases in the appeals process regarding eligibility of applicants for CPP disability benefits. With the recent development of sophisticated analytical tools and the changes to the process where the Division will move to assess errors of fact or law at the second level of appeal and the existing appeals bodies (Review Tribunal and Pensions Appeals Board) will wind down their operation, it is now possible to refocus the work There is still a significant legacy of appeals that were filed with the previous Pension Appeals Board as well as those decided by the Review Tribunal that are now being appealed to the SST Appeal Division. The SST has determined that all such cases will be treated as per the previous regime. The current challenge is to incorporate medical expertise into innovative policy and program development. There is a need to produce better business intelligence to support cost-effective, sustainable, consistent decisions. This will be accomplished by using knowledge of modern medical developments to influence the determination and management of disability files; analyze cases and develop strategies and policies; conduct research and report on issues related to CPPD; and offer consultation on medical issues within CPPD and the Department. As the legacy winds down, the Division will increasingly be able to refocus. The Director oversees the development of updated policy frameworks, and the establishment of evidence requirements such as functional assessments. The Director establishes policies, standards and approaches for the review of CPP disability files by Medical Advisors and established policy direction and learnings that can be shared more broadly with Medical Adjudicators to ensure consistency in the application of legislation, and the development of medical direction and advice to Service Canada to inform guidelines, procedures and training. The Director monitors, reviews and consults to identify potential for improvements to policy and the program. Human resources management skills will be utilized in identifying staff development needs, initiating training to improve professional skills and knowledge and recruiting medical professionals. The Director promotes team building, effective communications and a work environment that is productive and efficient. Congruent with this challenge is the requirement to understand the operating environment of the Department and best practices in business management, in order to bring the Division in line with the Department's principles of prevention, accountability and continuous improvement. The Director liaises with, and promotes participation by Medical Advisors in the national professional medical community and various provincial, national and international health and disability organizations, to exchange information on Director.

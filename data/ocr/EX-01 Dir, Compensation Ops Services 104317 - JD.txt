NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Lead by five Ministers and six Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. 2
ESDC s Human Resources Services Branch (HRSB) is responsible for developing and delivering people management policies, programs and services for ESDC, Service Canada and the Labour Program. The Branch provides expert advice and recommendations to ESDC's Ministers, the Deputy Minister of ESDC, Deputy Heads, numerous Assistant Deputy Ministers (ADMs) and other senior government officials. To deliver on this mandate, the Branch focusses on strengthening the workforce for the future, modernizing HR service and program delivery, and enabling a healthy, high-performing and inclusive workplace. Further, one of the major functions of the Branch is accountability for ensuring that ESDC employees are paid in an accurate and timely manner, consistent with central agency policy and direction. Under the terms of an agreement with PSPC, the HRSB Compensation Directorate provides compensation services for some 42,OOO employees across the ESDC, Service Canada and Labour Program Portfolio. This includes the processing of HR transactions leading to pay and benefits outcomes for all employees, including leave without pay, return from leave, retirement and resignation, the escalation, investigation and resolution of highly complex and sensitive pay issues. HRSB is also instrumental in the planning, development and delivery of major transformation projects designed to achieve operational efficiencies, improve service delivery, modernize and streamline the Department's HR-to-Pay business operations. In this context, the Director, Compensation Operations is accountable for the development, implementation, and continuous improvement of the program framework for compensation operations, including compensation practices, procedures, guidelines, systems, tools and performance standards. In an evolving operating environment, the Director is expected to manage departmental expectations at every level, as well as managing relationships with the Pay Centre. Also, the incumbent's operational work bleeds into corporate partnerships such as unions, departmental Champions, and central agencies, and the Director must handle those relationships deftly with a view to ongoing cooperation. Further, with the repatriation of leave without pay, return from leave, retirement and resignation, the Director faces a significant challenge in positioning the Directorate for a seamless transition to the upcoming new compensation system. This is in addition to ensuring the seamless implementation of processes for the integrated HR and Pay model and leads an integrated workforce. The incumbent directs the identification and resolution of issues as they arise. As the Department's subject matter expert on compensation operations, the Director provides well-informed, integrated advice, briefings, and recommendations to the Director General, ADM and other senior executives across the Department. The incumbent provides expert input on past practices to labour relations executives involved in the negotiation of collective agreements. The Director's front-line experiences in compensation operations provide excellent insight into how to craft pay terms and conditions that do not generate problems post- implementation. The incumbent is relied on to provide sound and strategic advice that senior officials can act upon with confidence, especially when advice and recommendations are required on short notice, and solutions could be played out in the media and Parliament. The Director provides expert input to the ADM and Deputy Minister in preparations for meetings of the Pay Transition Committee and other executive fora. The Director is relied on to provide strong and strategic leadership in building and expanding capacity among the community of ESDC s compensation operations specialists. This is 3
essential to improving ESDC s employees experience and maintaining its standing as one of Canada s top employers. Integral to the successful development of ESDC s compensation community of practice is training and continuous learning. The Director oversees the development of training and continuous learning in compensation operations where the learning curve for employees new to compensation can vary from I6 months to two full years. The incumbent develops recruitment and retention strategies specific to compensation operations that equip ESDC with the required level of trained resources to process all transaction types in keeping with service standards. A specific challenge for the Director on that front is to ensure recruitment and capacity are maintained and well predicted in time and ahead of requirements to provide the resources to organizations that will require increased capacity to offer and sustain the level of services required for the department. The Director collaborates with colleagues in the Directorate and other areas of HRSB in the development of compensation career paths and succession plans that contribute to employee satisfaction and increase retention. While the Director is accountable for compensation operations, the incumbent must remain cognizant of the interconnections and at times interdependencies of other HR disciplines. This increases the complexity of the work and presents an intellectual challenge in correctly interpreting collective agreements and the interplay between compensation and, for example, labour relations and staffing. Other operational challenges arise from the need to sustain the momentum of transaction processing on the legacy system as well as HR-to-Pay, underpinned and complicated by the implementation of PeopleSoft 9.2. The incumbent provides compensation operations expertise in testing and managing change to new technologies, systems and applications such as myEMS (PeopleSoft 9.2). This is in support of ESDC s vanguard role for the federal system and the Director works with HRSB HR Systems Division and IITB specialists to share intelligence on systems issues and find and test solutions. The Director plays an important part in this implementation because ESDC acts as a vanguard in the adoption of myEMS (PeopleSoft 9.2). In this, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) looks to ESDC to leverage its HR systems pathfinding role which consists of the creation, testing, and deployment of new technologies, systems and applications in ESDC for use across the federal system. As a myEMS business owner, the incumbent works with HRSB HR Systems Division and the Innovative, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) specialists to share intelligence on systems issues and find solutions. The Director is expected to successfully navigate the complex HR and pay landscape that currently exists and participate in the transition to new systems, all involving the requirements of complex collective agreements and solutions that work effectively in both official languages. In addition to processing repatriated transactions, the Director oversees the design and delivery of remedial strategies to clear the backlog of pay action requests from ESDC employees. Clearing the backlog, often involving complex, multi-year pay problems, is challenging but essential to the financial well-being of employees and their focus and productivity. Further, the Director ensures the provision of liaison and triage support of grievance and complex escalation cases that are raised through various channels. The Director oversees the review and triaging of pay-related grievances, including a full file review and the preparation of notes to support grievance hearings. The incumbent is the ESDC subject-matter expert in the development of grievance resolutions 4
related to pay action processing. To this end, the incumbent is considered as the departmental functional authority to review all cases brought forward in forms of grievances or complaints and must ensure that all employe compensation information is valid, reliable and accurately represented by transactions already processed. The Director is the pay data owner and must ensure data integrity through systems and the secure storage of data specific to pay actions is essential for several reasons. Errors in employees pay, some resulting in hardship for employees, have generated litigation by individuals, class action suits and the creation of a Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with signatory bargaining agents to compensate federal employees for damages. The Department of Justice issued a document saying that pay records, complaints and applications for fixes to the pay system should all be retained for the purposes of the MOA and the Director is accountable for ensuring that the data are safely archived. This is in addition to day-to-day data management responsibilities. The Director represents the Directorate, Branch and Department in internal/external compensation fora, speaking authoritatively on behalf of the Director General in consultations and negotiations with central agencies, including PSPC and TBS on matters relating to the compensation function. The incumbent builds and maintains sound working relationships with multiple bargaining agents at the national level and addresses concerns regarding compensation in an effort to resolve issues before they become complicated and interactions acrimonious. To accomplish this, the Director's challenge is to identify opportunities and develop collaborative partnership efforts with the compensation community, TBS and several internal and external partners to take advantage of the opportunities and respond to potential risks. The Director provides input to the development of and leads the implementation and regular updating of performance measurement frameworks and the preparation of reports detailing results, including monthly reports to the DM on results. The framework establishes performance expectations based on operating standards that enable the comparison of results year over year and the Director is accountable for the results. Metrics have changed in light of federal accessibility initiatives and legislation, and compensation operations must change accordingly. The repatriated transactions and transition to HR-to-Pay, processes must be viewed through the accessibility lens. The Director leads by influence and example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining professional expertise. The incumbent is a member of the Directorate management committee and other senior decision-making fora] and influences decisions on policies, programs, and investments. The Director must demonstrate strong management and operational skills, sound judgement and operating environment acumen, and manages allocated resources with probity.

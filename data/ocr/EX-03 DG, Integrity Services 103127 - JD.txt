NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), ESDC delivers programs and services to each and every Canadian throughout their lives in a significant capacity. ESDC is responsible for developing policies that ensure Canadians can use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community; delivers programs that help Canadians move through life's transitions, from school to work, from one job to another, from unemployment to employment, from the workforce to retirement; provide income support to seniors, families with children and those unemployed due to job loss, illness or caregiving responsibilities; help Canadians with distinct needs such as Indigenous people, persons with disabilities, homeless people, travelers and recent immigrants; ensures labour relations stability through the provision of dispute prevention and resolution services promoting fair, safe and healthy workplace conditions, promoting decent work and employment equity, and fostering respect for international labour standards. Service Canada, as the national service delivery arm of ESDC, helps Canadians access government services and benefits by providing seamless, comprehensive one-stop service, advice, guidance and assistance to Canadians, delivered in a way that meets program objectives, and ensure a positive service experience for Canadians. Service Canada represents the primary face of the Government of Canada in meeting the everyday requirements of its Citizens. This service delivery approach simplifies government and increases the accessibility and ease with which anyone needing Government of Canada information and services can successfully obtain what they need when they need it. Service delivery is based on four fundamental principles: access for all Canadians, an interactive relationship with citizens and communities, demonstrable service excellence, and sustainable federal presence. There are 4 Regional Branches, each responsible for program, service and business delivery throughout Canada. The delivery of programs within a regional context allows each region to develop particular expertise based on their proximity to the service recipient / client. This allows them to be adeptly equipped to provide integration of regional realities into the operationalization of program policies and direction, leading pilot projects for national initiatives thus ensuring objectives align with end results and delivery objectives. The regional programs are managed in a complex framework that provides federal services within an integrated, distributed governance model supporting federal and departmental policy and program development. These regional programs provide, in addition to the pre-existing ESDC programs, client services and advice in respect of other federal departments and agencies such access to passport services. Integrity Services Branch is responsible for monitoring, enhancing and strengthening the integrity of Departmental and Service Canada services and programs that provide benefits to Canadians. The Branch s mandate is to ensure that the right person receives the right service or benefit at the right time, and for the intended purpose. The Branch s core responsibility is to prevent, detect and deter misrepresentation and abuse against Service Canada programs and service offerings. It is within this context that the DG, ISB is accountable for providing leadership and direction for the region's integrity services, including Emergency Management, Business Continuity, Integrity and Corporate security functions. As such, the DG is the regional authority, accountable for ensuring departmental information, assets and services are protected against compromise and that individuals are protected against workplace violence and hazards. The mandate extends to fostering the Department's ability to maintain the continued delivery of services that contribute to the health, safety, economic well-being and security of Canadians, to advance regional and national priorities and ensure the integrity of multiple highly visible and complex government programs. The DG, in Directing the Region's program, ensures the integrity of the regional delivery for over $I2O billion (nationally) in services and benefits to Canadians, thereby ensuring that services and benefits are distributed within the region, are allocated to Canadians in a manner respecting the legislatively defined requirements and that oversight and controls are in place to ensure that business streams adhere to national operational control policies, procedures, processes and standards to mitigate identity fraud or other activities leading to diversion of funds and benefits. DG, Integrity Services Page 2 of 5 January Ist, 2OI9
As DG, ISB and agent of change, the role is critical in providing innovative and creative leadership which fosters and shapes the successful implementation of the Service Canada vision and mandate by proactively integrating, from an Integrity Services lens, strategies and services to ensure both corporate obligations and program delivery occur in an effective and efficient manner. Furthermore, the DG, ISB promotes continually evolving and innovative approaches, such as integrity by design, meaning the full integration of business considerations across all programs and services, when developing new approaches, or introducing new technologies and systems to the Department, ensuring to embed integrity interventions and controls throughout the benefit and service life-cycle. The DG is responsible for formulating and developing regional strategies and frameworks and advocating for, and representing the interests and concerns of the Integrity Services business stream. The DG, in directing the delivery of these services, ensures success of the policy continuum, leading the region's integrity apparatus in the application and operationalization of central agency and national headquarters initiatives, while also shaping and recommending new directions, thinking, and innovation for program delivery nationally, based on regional and operational results. A major challenge for the DG, ISB is the ongoing requirement to develop regional frameworks required to ensure the integrity, safety and security of an ever increasing number of programs, services, benefits, information and databases requiring proactive integration and leadership across all business lines in the region to embed and ensure protection of assets, persons and information is taken into consideration whether delivering a service, developing a program, or determining a new approach to doing business in addition to assessing and providing leadership for continually evolving security environments and emergency planning, given the significant impacts unforeseen and adverse events can have on operations. Another major challenge for the DG, ISB, is coping with and adjusting to ever evolving and complex technology, fraud schemes, systems, and capacities while ensuring integrity functions are integrated into various controls and evolve in lockstep with criminal elements. The DG must adapt and adjust direction to ensure the security of information, people, and assets. There is an immense shift towards digitization, automation and virtual platforms, which adds an additional layer of complexity for protection of information and privacy. This requires the DG ISB to provide advice and guidance to senior leadership in the region to facilitate innovation and the development of strategic direction ensuring the provision of leadership through horizontal input into all programs and service delivery. Key to this challenge is the leadership of strategic regional pilots based on operational realities and findings to guide and shape regional work, policy direction and guide modernization of service delivery. A further challenge for the DG, ISB is the political sensitivity of departmental programs and activities and their high visibility in the public eye. The focus on ensuring public confidence in program delivery and integrity/security elements by ensuring that allocations are provided in line with legislated intentions and direction, along with a renewed prioritization on adjudication leads to delicate and contentious investigations which can be perceived as insensitive. Nonetheless, the DG must navigate this environment and provide senior leadership to support the integrity of program and service delivery, and the security of Canadians personal information. Lastly, an increasingly challenging responsibility for the DG ISB is the occurrence and impact of major catastrophic events, whether related to climate change (floods, fires, etc.), pandemics (COVID, SARS, etc.), criminal activities (identity theft, mass shootings, etc.), which have refocused prioritization on sound emergency planning and management. The DG must oversee and lead the development of emergency plans across all regional business lines and ensure the region is prepared to meet these emergencies. When such events do occur, the DG, must activate emergency plans, teams and procedures and lead the region through the emergency. The DG provides extensive advisory services, strategic options, position papers and briefing material for senior management in the region and at national headquarters, including the Deputy Minister's and Minister's offices. It provides executive leadership, defines and defends the vision and establishes the direction of the development and implementation of strategic, operational, financial, and human resource plans within its business line, and assesses the impacts across all regional business lines and program delivery services; participates in the development of regional strategies and policies. The DG is continuously leading engagement activities and fostering collaborative relationships with key senior and executive level stakeholders at both regional and national levels, and across a wide range of industry pillars to ensure strategic linkages and partnerships are made in order to better respond to the unique realities and challenges of each Region, including how best to leverage and share common information, practices and collaborate on initiatives, and meet the departmental commitment to service excellence. The DG extensively provides briefings to senior government leadership, including senior management at regional and national levels, Members of Parliament, and other levels of governments such as municipal and provincial/territorial. The DG is accountable for achieving regional targets and prioritizing enforcement activities which lead to adjudication as a result of investigations into fraud, compliance issues or other irregularities. The RDG is accountable for oversight DG, Integrity Services Page 3 of 5 January Ist, 2OI9
activities, including inspections, in order to increase public confidence in terms of integrity of government programs and service delivery. The DG must develop and implement regional enforcement and compliance frameworks ensuring the region can anticipate, mitigate and eliminate wrongdoing. The DG is accountable for, and shapes regional Emergency Management planning, and as such, continuously promotes an integrated and resilient whole of region approach to emergency management planning, including leading the formulation or better prevention/mitigation of and preparedness for, response to and recovery from emergencies. This also includes chairing the Regional Emergency Operations Centre, and being a member of the National Emergency Operations Centre. This role directs, and is the regional authority in leading and formulating new ways in how to plan, prepare, and respond to immediate effects and impacts of disasters. This requires ongoing leadership, timely decision making, effective communication and coordination of activities and resources at a strategic and operational level. The DG must strategize and formulate a clear vision for the programs, continuously anticipating, monitoring and investigating risks to program and service delivery, ensuring the continuous introduction of preventative measures, and enforcement, to mitigate inadvertent or active internal or external actions that may lead to loss or diversion of funds or fraudulent activities. In order to meet its challenges and responsibilities, the DG must have a mastery of the theories, concepts, practices and methodology related to integrity, security, enforcement and compliance, emergency management and business continuity, as well as its linkages to the extensive governmental programs, benefits and services delivered by Service Canada. The DG must also possess extensive knowledge of acts, legislation, policies, procedures and practices of Service Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada, the Financial Administration Act, and Treasury Board policies and guidelines to adapt the integrity program, its policies and frameworks, interpret and provide advice and guidance to senior decision makers and ensure compliance with acts, legislation, central agency and departmental requirements. There is also a requirement for the DG to keep abreast of threats, trends, emerging technology, issues and initiatives to identify aspects of the program and client delivery frameworks that need improvements and provide recommendations to the department's senior management team. The work also requires broad knowledge, seasoned experience and sound business acumen in the direction and management of large, complex program delivery operations. It requires extensive, in-depth knowledge and understanding of the GOC-wide and Department strategic directions, priorities and business operations, as well as the business risks. Excellent managerial and people skills are required to lead and provide strategic direction. The DG, represents the department in the region, and provides senior executive leadership and direction to ensure both regional alignment with the priorities of ESDC and Service Canada, and that the priorities of the region are well reflected, sharing a joint accountability with NHQ for development of policy, strategies and the implementation of integrity and security measures throughout the Department.

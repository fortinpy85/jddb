Principal, Advisory and Special Studies (AS-O7) : The Principal is responsible for providing strategic analysis and advice to the CAE on key : departmental areas, such as privacy & security, risk management, performance measurement : and other horizontal management areas in support of his role on various governance committees ! and his relationships with departmental senior management including the Deputy Ministers (DM), : Associate DM and Chief Operating Officer. The provision of strategic analysis and advice is to assist the CAE and the Internal Audit function to connect-the-dots across the many areas of | management, so as to improve overall management efficiency and effectiveness of governance, , risk management and contro! environments. : In addition, this strategic analysis and advice to senior management can also take the form of ! Carrying-out specific management reviews that focus on key areas of concern to senior : management and actively participating on various management level committees, working groups i and task forces (e.g. privacy renewal task forces, Grants & Contributions Directors & OGs | Committees. Director & DG level Identity Management Working Groups, among others). | | Also reporting to the Director is an Executive Assistant (AS-I). : NATURE AND SCOPE I Employment and Social Development. Canada (ESOC) is a large and complex Department that | supports Canadians throughout their lives. The mission of ESDC's portfolio, which includes the : Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a strong and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve their quality of life. The Department delivers a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives through three business lines: program that support human | : . fesources and skills development, the Labour Program and Service Canada. The mission is ' accomplished through the development of policies to promote a society in which all Canadians , are able to use their talents. skills and resources in order to participate in learning, work and in . their communities. ESDC creates programs and initiatives to support Canadians as they move . through the transitions of lite and to create enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service | excellence in partnership with other departments and agencies and with other orders of i government. The combined Portfolio workforce exceeds twenty thousand employees who are located in ail regions of the country. : The ESDC Portfolio operates within a complex governance and accountability structure that i supports the Minister of ESDC, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of State (Seniors) and a : Parliamentary Secretary. ESDC is responsible for poticy and program development and for the delivery of Government programs, services and benefits. To fulfill its mission, the Department is responsible for supporting a flexible, national labour market: increasing participation in the labour : force; removing barriers to post-secondary education attainment and skills development; overseeing federal labour responsibilities; providing income support to senior, families with I children and Employment Insurance beneficiaries; and delivering Government of Canada (GoC) programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies. Included in these core roles are responsibilities for the design and delivery of some of the GoC's most well-known statutory programs and services, including, Old Age Security; the Canada Pension Plan; Employment Insurance; Canada Students Loans and Grants; the Canada Education Savings Program; the i National Child Benefit, and the Universal Child care benefit. | Labour Canada is responsible for overseeing federal labour responsibilities, including facilitating H compliance with labour laws, occupational health and safety, and labour standards, as well as assisting trade unions and employers in the negotiation of collective agreements and their renewal in federally regulated workplaces. The Program represents Canada in international labour organizations and negotiates and implements labour provisions in the context of trade liberalization initiatives. | ~Page2OffOO SSS
| Through Service Canada, the Department helps Canadians access programs, as well as other D. GoC programs and services, at more than 6OO points of service across the country. In addition to . in-person services, the organization serves the needs of Canadians online, by telephone and its | network of program-based call centres. | Finally, through grants and contributions, the Department provides funding to other orders of : government and organizations such as the voluntary and private sector, educators and community organizations to support projects that meet the labour market and social development : needs of Canadians. | ESDC will continue to evolve to achieve better results for Canadians while safeguarding ! taxpayers dollars. The Department's business transformation and modernization initiatives help ; the Department to reduce costs, enhance program integrity and improve service. ESDC will also i be making improvements to policies and programs by updating program design and implementing : new service delivery upgrades to meet the changing needs of Canadians. Finally, the : Department is working to build a high-performing and adaptable organization by improving its / management practices and its enabling infrastructure so that it can continue to meet Canadians | : needs in the future. I : The Department will continue to monitor risks associated with the implementation of the change , agenda and their possible impact on the implementation of new initiatives, Core programs and service standards. These risks are driven by three main factors: the scope and complexity of changes; the impact of change on the Department's employees; and, most importantly, the cumulative risk of having such a high number of transformation activities being undertaken concurrently. ] ESDC will continue to rely on its mitigation and monitoring strategies, including enhanced monitoring by senior-level committees and through the continued implementation of the Information Technology Services Model, Investment Plan, Workforce Management Strategy and ! National Learning Policy to identify and react to any escalating risks in a timely fashion. In : addition, increased monitoring and reporting on various transformation initiatives will be undertaken to provide early indicators of areas requiring attention. This will make certain that I public resources are used efficiently and effectively, and ensure that they are targeted to the i highest levei of departmental priorities to meet objectives. | The portfolio nature of the Department, as well as the complex financial arrangements with other : Federal departments and agencies, and with the Provincial governments, presents major i challenges to IASB that are unique in the federal government. The challenges are those of . individual mandates for each of the Portfolio organizations, the inter-departmental and inter- governmental financial arrangements and the three distinct sources of funding (i.e. CRF, the | Employment Insurance Account and the Canada Pension Fund Account). The diversity and I visibility of Portfolio programs. services and benefits plus the magnitude of the expenditures involved {i.e. $IIO.3 billion annually) and the size of the workforce (i.e. over twenty thousand) are further challenging factors that complicate the intemal audit function. ! In addition to strengthening the delivery of programs, services and benefits to Canadians, the GoC has placed a priority on improving financial management through the Office of the Comptroller General (OCG). The OCG works to strengthen financial management and internal ! audit practices across the federal public service and thereby support the overall effectiveness of | public administration in Canada, and provides functional direction to the internal audit function ! and to the CAE ! : The Management Accountability Framework (MAF) for the GoC is a key performance : management tool that the federal government uses to support the management accountability of deputy heads and, improve management practices across departments and agencies. MAF summarizes the vision behind various management reforms into ten high-level management | PpageSofO = =~=~ (Si ( U;*; i;:S .
. : expectations of deputy heads including, turning Governance and Strategic Directions into Results . and Performance; promote a culture supported by strong Public Service Values, Learning, . Innovation and Change Management, and stress Management excellence in the areas of Stewardship, Policy and Programs, Risk management, Citizen-focused Service, Accountability and People Management. The MAF articulates a set of government-wide expectations for sound management and establishes the framework of accountability for Deputy Heads to ensure that . the conditions for good management are put into place. To that effect, the internal audit function is an essential! component of the Department's : management framework as it supports senior management in the effective discharge of ; significant responsibilities by providing independent and objective opinions and advice on the effectiveness and efficiencies of operations. IASB contributes to enhancing accountability and performance by assessing departmental risk management, contro! and governance processes to ensure program targets, plans are aligned with departmental objectives and priorities; resources are acquired, used effectively, and adequately protected; management and operations are : effective and efficient; risks are appropriately identified and managed; quality and continuous j improvement are fostered in the departmental control processes; financial, managerial, and | Operating information is accurate, reliable, and timely, with feedback to decision making mechanisms; compliance with policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and : regulations is achieved; and legislative or regulatory issues affecting the Department are recognized and addressed. The Financial Administration Act (FAA) and the formulation of a new policy and directives aimed at strengthening the overall internal audit function in support of more transparent and accountable government. The Accounting Officer model recognizes the Deputy Head in each Department as the accounting officer who is accountable to the House of Commons and the Senate. It also provides the Deputy Heads and the Comptroller General of Canada with the added assurance independent from line management on risk management, contro! and governance processes (i.e. the internal audit function). | The 78 Policy on internal Audit (revised April I, 2OI2) contributes to the improvement of public . | sector management by ensuring strong, credible, effective and sustainable internal audit function within departments as well as government-wide. The Poficy also provides a clear and integrated ' assignment of responsibilities for internal auditing between deputy heads and the Comptroller i General. Internal audit is critical to effective and credible governance and for improving the | independence, objectivity and overall effectiveness of the function. It also reflects a more principles-based and risk management perspective. : Internal audit plays a significant rote in terms of influencing management, contributing to change : management, as well as driving change. In order to achieve this internal audit must develop ! robust strategies and plans, including an annual RBAP, programs and recommendations, which ' consider the size, complexity and diversity of ESDC's programs and operations. In addition, the ' sheer volume of transactions requires the Department to have a strong control framework in place to ensure stewardship of assets. Internal audit must ensure that the strategies put in place include assessments of the control frameworks (including financial) to contribute to minimizing errors due to control weaknesses, which if not discovered could have significant cumulative : ; impacts. | . | The last few years saw a significant amount of modemization and transition at the departmental : evel, due in large part to the Deficit Reduction Action Plan (DRAP) following the Strategic Review : (SR), including several major transformations which were under way. For the near future, the reality remains one of modernization, transformation and adjustment in a context of financial constraints. As a result of the increase in the management, oversight and the upward and extemal requirements facing roles and responsibilities of the [ASB, there is a need for a position to play a ~ Page 4 of IO ; | |
I senior advisor role to the CAE on issues of a horizontal nature and scope that are mission critical : for the IA function. It is within this context that the Director, Professional Practices and Special Examinations provides the professional and managerial leadership for |ASB's centre of Internal Audit (IA) : expertise engaged in: providing expert support to the CAE, DM and departmental DAC to : enhance the conduct of ESDC s IA program; developing and guiding the implementation of IASB audit policies. professional standards, practices, strategic and annual audit plans and projects: ; monitoring and ensuring quality assurance over audits conducted by IASB; reporting annually to i the DAC on the quality of the performance of IASB audits; and conducting audit follow-up on the implementation of audit reports to ensure required corrective actions are taken The Director is accountable for developing and sustaining IASB's corporate governance and Management frameworks and for ensuring they create an effective and professional regime to support the Branch in the conduct of its mandate. Essential underpinnings of IASB s IA regime/framework are: the research activities directed by the Director to assess IA emerging i issues and events, best practices in other jurisdictions and to conduct joint ventures with other ! federal partners on innovative and leading-edge practices; and the development of an enterprise- i wide audit risk profile to identify and define risk areas in governance, stewardship and program | across ESDC that are used to enhance the IASB s and DAC s IA planning and oversight roles. ! All the above functions are couched in terms of integrity and accountability at the broadest level, j and set out a range of options to address IASB issues. Consequently, the incumbent must | ensure a consistent and flexible audit program framework, readily adaptable to a fiuid | environment. : The Director directs the development of IASB's annual audit plan that addresses areas of higher : risk and relevance for ESDC and includes audits identified by the DAC, the Deputy and the OCG : as part of government-wide of sectoral coverage, and supports the CAE s annual reporting on the : quality of ESDC's governance, risk management, and contro! processes. The Director is | responsible for the conceptualization, design, development and implementation of a , comprehensive RBAP development framework for |ASB. To that effect, the Director ensures that the assessment of departmental risks, priorities and other sources of departmental business intelligence is used to develop the annual RBAP. The recommendations made by the Director in i the annual RBAP can have a serious impact on the quality of decisions made by senior . : management. | The Director is accountable for leading the development and implementation of a consistent audit i concept and approach across the Department through the use of strategic communications and : analysis of departmental sources of business intelligence. A major component of this activity involves culture change. which is far greater challenge than changing processes. The messages must clearly convey the role and responsibilities of IASB and management, and what adjustments | must be made by all stakeholders to effectively carry out their responsibilities and ! accountabilities. The challenge is to increase the understanding of audit concepts and their ] relativity to ESDC management, operations and service delivery and to demonstrate the | Opportunities to leverage audits for the overall benefit of the Department. The Director is | accountable for providing strong IA expertise in the development of an IA governance framework, : ! which is structures to accommodate the heavy workload of the integrated IASB, and to be receptive to enhanced interfaces and/or integration with other key corporate frameworks (e.g : MAF). The Director provides feadership for major corporate outreach activities on this and other i knowledge and information brokering initiatives, in order to inform and engage all levels within f IASB and the Program Branches and Regions. This involves the development of communications i and continuous leaming strategies appropriately tailored to meet the needs of the target i audiences within |ASB and the departments. i The Director establishes the corporate focal point for the formulation and implementation of | IASB's strategic audit planning framework, and professionai audit policies, standards, practices, | BagesofIO ne
+ methodologies, guides and tools that govem and enhance the conduct of all activities. This : requires the incumbent to develop and recommend strategies, approaches and initiatives. to ensure that the Branch has the capacity to meet its mandated, independent oversight role and responsibilities. The Director leads the planning, development and implementation of the policy frameworks for audits and studies, as well as Quality Assurance (QA) policies and standards, for : each phase of the audit process. The incumbent is also called upon to develop an overall : strategic approach for selecting audits that is aligned with departmental corporate objectives and i address the risks and priorities. It is important in fulfilling these responsibilities that the Director ensures full consultation with all stakeholders, including the Deputy and the DAC conceming the development of national policies, processes and systems (e.g. management, accountability, : performance measurement, etc.), to ensure their adequacy and the resulting support and : acceptance of these core stakeholders and partners. The Director faces a major challenge in developing and sustaining ESDC 's expertise in Special Examinations. To accomplish this, the Director jeads the development of research and : improvement initiatives for special examinations and ensures the harmonization of related : activities with the integrity Services Branch and Legal Services. The Director manages such : special examinations and supports the CAE in dealing with related sensitivities and in briefing the i OM, the Minister and Parliamentary Committees, where necessary, on the implications of the ; findings and the best resolution strategies to ensure that all levels of interest perceive the issue : has been adequately addressed. As part of this Internal Audit responsibility, the Director is accountable for ensuring all facets of | the TBS Directive on Losses of Money or Property are properly reflected in the IASB and ESDC's associated planning, policy and management frameworks and activities. The Director is accountable for investigating, reporting on and making recommendations for appropriate actione- _---- - ] related to all losses of money, allegations of offences and illegal acts against the Crown and other improprieties. While the launch of special examinations may result from the receipt of complaints, many more are initiated as a result of the IASB s overall program activities including the assessment of the state of management practices and controls in the Department. Any IASB auditor who, during the course of his/her normal activities, acquires knowtedge or uncovers Information indicating that an offence or illegal act may have been committed, is responsible to inform the CAE and the Director, of the issue. This results in many cases being reviewed to determine whether a special j examination is required. In addition, the Director directs the development and use of computer- assisted audit techniques and profiling tools to detect situations, which may warrant special i examinations. !n all cases, the Director is charged to initiate the investigations into suspicions or ; allegations of fraud or financial or other improprieties. Itis essential that the Director establishes and maintains strong links with the departmental! Legal : Services and the Integrity Services Branch for these specialized audit activities to seek advice on : the seriousness of findings where it is not really apparent that immediate response by a police : agency is required. The Director directs the development of recommendations for the | consideration of the CAE, the Associate DMs, the Deputy, the DAC and senior managers of | ESDC on actions to be taken regarding examination findings. | A sensitive challenge for the Director with regards to this specialized audit activity is that it is not : always evident at the beginning of an investigation that a fraud may have occurred. Yet, it is : important the appropriate branches and law enforcement agencies be notified as early as possible if criminal action is suspected. While legal counsel can be sought, the Director, in consultation with the CAE needs to make judgement calls on these cases. An erroneous judgement can lead to unwarranted embarrassment to the organization for initiating an unnecessary criminal investigation or, on the other hand, lead to a claim that the organizations were negligent in exercising their responsibilities to report suspicion of criminal activity to law enforcement agencies quickly. : Bg GofIO22~~O*SOSOS ~*~C~SCSCSCSSSSSS |
' Another critical responsibility for the incumbent is to ensure that all audits and engagements : executed by [ASB employ the most appropriate tools and methodologies, meet professional Standards, incorporate the appropriate quality contro! processes and can withstand the scrutiny of senior management, the DAC, Parkament and the general public. In meeting this responsibility, : the incumbent provides expert advice on departmental audit priorities, on the specific scope for i audits and on audit approaches and methodologies. The Director oversees the production of H high-risk studies and special investigations with the view to ensuring the appropriateness of | methodologies and the timeliness of production of reports related to individual audits studies and | special examinations. t i The Director ensures IASB s QA program provides the best data and information to guide the . overall planning and conduct of ESDC s Intemal Audit Program and the most viable and credible advice and reports to the DAC. In providing feadership, the Director works closely with \ departmental executives and Program Branches to assess the quality and timeliness of audits ' conducted, and the validity of criteria and standards used in commenting on audit results and : recommendations. Professional leadership is required to ensure the results stemming from QA : activities enhance iASB s capacity to assess the performance of departmental programs and : services in relation to the department's strategic corporate goals and priorities, as well to the government's legislative and policy agenda, within broad criteria such as efficiency and effectiveness, outputs, overali performance, client satisfaction, and value for money. QA provides managers, the Director, Operations and the CAE with the necessary information and recommendations to take timely action to ensure that IA audit reports and working papers adhere to the highest professional standards. As part of the QA responsibility, the Director is called upon . to develop and incorporate the concepts, principles and practices of quality management and . develop a system designed to build in quality in each phase of the audit process. I A key component of the QA process directed by the incumbent is the commissioning of external inspections of the |ASB's IA frameworks, activities and results by independent and professionally qualified audit organizations. Through this external review, the Director ensures that an objective . assessment has been made of the departmental overall audit capacity and that strength, . deficiencies and weaknesses are reported to the CAE and the DAC for remedial action. A major business challenge for the Director is the ongoing responsibility to create a comprehensive and coherent strategy for capacity building across ESDC s internal Audit community. The strategy must be structured such that it enables [ASB to take advantage of existing IA capacity, identifies capacity gaps and long and short term remedies, and sets forward agenda for sustainable IA community development, resulting in performance excellence. The Director leads an innovative approach that combines long term planning that directly supports the : responsibility for ESDC-wide oversight and assurance through an audit function. Through the introduction and maintenance of IA standards and processes and ongoing capacity and community development, the incumbent fosters a high degree of professionalism and expertise that are conducive to strengthening IA service delivery and performance. The Director plays a : key role in the development and ongoing evaluation of audit structures and functions within IASB : to ensure that they are responsive to a dynamic operating environment. This role is heavily premised on the credibility of [ASB as a centre of expertise on audit and management strategies, and therefore, capacity building and the fostering of mechanisms and processes to enhance | recruitment, retention and development of the IA community is critical. The Director provides the : ! corporate leadership and direction to developmental programs for the entire range of positions in ! Internal Audit. This offers a major challenge to ensure that these !A development programs remain current and supportive of the future needs of ESDC and fit within the continuum of audit development. The incumbent therefore must oversee the development and imptementation of an . integrated framework that supports: needs analysis, projection and planning; recruitment and retention strategies; professional development, and core learning, and the evaluation of each of . those factors to fine-tune approaches and improve performance and results.

- In addition, the Director also directs the delivery of IASB, ATIP and information management . : functions. The ATIP role is especially challenging as ESDC is a very high profile department and. : its policies and programs come under strong scrutiny by a number of stakeholders including ! industry, interest groups, the media, NGOs and the general public. Given the role of IASB and | the profile of its audits, which include extremely sensitive special examinations, there has been increasing demand for access to departmental reports and documents. The incumbent must ensure the optimal processing of these requests which includes detailed interactions with the responsible programs, senior management and also the Department's Legal Services to ensure compliance with all relevant legislation including ATIP and ESDC legislation and regulations as well as jurisprudence in this complex field. The Director displays great discretion in determining | approaches that are acceptable to senior management, comply with the Acts and will be H supportable in case of challenge by the Commission of Access and/or Privacy and legal | representatives of requesting parties. .

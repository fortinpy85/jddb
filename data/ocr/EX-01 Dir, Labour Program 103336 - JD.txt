Human Resources Development Canada @ une AND SCOPE When the Department of Human Resources Development Canada was formed in I993, the former Department of Labour was one of the major components of the new Department. Now HRSDC (Human Resources and Social Development Canada) it focuses on the management of the labour market, employment and employability, learning and literacy, income security, economic well being, social policy and development and other human resources development issues, including labour. Due to the recognized importance of the Labour program and its differing client, stakeholder and partner base, this component of the new Department was assigned a Minister to oversee the federal Labour portfolio. While the Labour program works within the HRSDC context, its policy and operational focuses and associated initiatives and activities operate in a largely separate and distinct fashion from those of the main priorities and programs of HRSDC. The national Labour Program also receives very strong functional direction and guidance from the ADM, Labour in National Headquarters due to the unique nature of the program and very specialized legislative, policy, planning and programs delivery frameworks and processes. Although the Labour Program has its own Minister, and the program delivery is handled somewhat distinctly from that of other HRSDC programs and services, it is critical that a Strong relationship flourish with the AREH and linkages be forged to ensure the end result of the strategic delivery of all HRSDC programs and services to the Canadian Public within the overall HRSDC program and accountability frameworks. The HRSDC Labour program administers Parts |, Il and Ill of the Canada Labour Code (CLC). Part | involves the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes and the resolution of labour/management conflict in the Federal Private Sector. While Headquarters basically delivers these services, the Regions provide significant local level information and input to the involved headquarters staff. The administration of Part Il of the CLC involves the provision of occupational safety and health services for federal jurisdiction industries and federal employees covered by the Public Service Staff Relations Act for collective bargaining. Part Ill covers the labour standards, occupational health and safety and industrial relations for private sector industries under federal jurisdiction. Federal jurisdiction includes, among other things, air transport, rail, inter-provincial trucking, international shipping, ports, long-shore, grain handling, inter-provincial and international communication, banking and First Nations. The work environment has become increasingly complex and sensitive over the past several years. Recent years have seen a globalization of business and cost pressures throughout Westem economies, giving rise to a rapid reduction in labour gains achieved through the bargaining process, the polarization of hours of work, and little or no increase in real wages in most sectors of the Canadian economy. Businesses are now highly sensitive to wage and benefit pressures, are intent on streamlining operations and see regulatory compliance as a cost item. Unions have seen their influence diminish, are struggling to redefine themselves around the new economy, and are launching new membership drives in service industries. A rapidly expanding 4 II-Jan-O8"
Human Resources Development Canada @oment of the population is now active in home business enterprises or is engaged in part-time work or job-sharing and is increasingly sensitive to benefits issues. In the dynamic of this labour market, the HRSDC Labour Program must guide the implementation of comprehensive workplace strategy that encompasses federal policy and program objectives, and utilizes the legislative and administrative tools of the Department to modernize the Canada Labour Code, the workplace, and the environment in a manner that balances economic, market-driven objectives with social goals, and contributes to the broader priorities of the Ministers of Labour and HRSDC. As the Regional Director, Labour Program, the incumbent provides strong leadership and regional direction on improvements and new service initiatives. It is essential that the Regional Director forge strong networks with the functional area(s) and all jurisdictions to ensure they are supportive of each other's goals and objectives, best harmonize funding activities and avoid duplication in their respective service delivery strategies and operations. This presents unique challenges as we move forward with E- Government. E-Government (including GOL), a new model of government for the 2I" century, will transform how public servants work, do business, organize, manage and engage citizens and other partners. There is not a clearly defined sense of what it will look like in 2OO5 and beyond but will start to be implemented by 2OO3. Under this framework for the modemization of the federal Labour portfolio and activities, major challenges and objectives include the need to: improve protection for workers; promote productivity through innovative workplace practices; promote more flexible working time arrangements; create harmonious workplaces through good industrial relations; support working environments that are safe and healthy; achieve diverse workplaces that are fair and equitable; and assist workers to increase skills and adopt life-long learning. Occupational Safety and Health has assumed a much higher profile with increased attention to accident prevention, joint safety responsibilities, the short and long-term effects on health of hazardous substances including chemicals, dust and asbestos, the psychological effects of new technologies, and court rulings on cases involving an employer's liability when unsafe working conditions are not addressed. Employment conditions and employee relations have also assumed new importance as a result of increased understanding by employees of their rights and entitlements, and the corresponding responsibility of employers to ensure fair and equitable treatment. As a consequence, standards legislation has become much broader in scope dealing with matters such as unjust dismissal and harassment, in addition to the traditional long hours of work and wage concepts. The impacts of the Labour Program can be significant on an industry wide or national level. Decisions relating to Safety and Health, Fire Protection and Labour Standards can have national impact and high profile. Lack of action, or inadequate levels of service, have legal liability consequences for the Minister, particularly in the area of Occupational Safety and Health. 5 II-Jan-O8
Human Resources Development Canada ... changes have resulted in the requirement for new techniques when dealing with issues in which the emphasis is shifting away from reliance only upon regulation and control in a policing sense, to one that includes persuasion and cooperation to voluntarily meet the legislated requirements. These changes have also contributed to the adoption of new non-legislated programs based on education and cooperation as exemplified by the Labour-Management Partnership Program. The Labour Program consists of several distinct regulatory and administrative components, and as a legacy of the previous Labour Canada organization, has responsibility in some program areas for two Regions. As such, delivery of the program presents unique challenges as the span of control for its delivery reaches beyond one s own regional boundaries, in this case, to the Alberta/Nunavut Region. There is the need to ensure the delivery of the Labour Program is within the parameters set out in the accountability framework while delivering the program in someone else s back yard. The Regional Director plays a key role in ensuring the awareness of the sensitivities and the following of essential protocols necessary in this unique situation. The Regional Director is expected to be an active member of various HRSDC national and regional committees which meet regularly to discuss representations on policies, programs and the management of the department's national Labour Program. The incumbent will sit as the Region s member of the Directorate Executive Committee, and the National Employment Implementation Coordinating Committee, and is also the chair of various HRDC-provincial or federal-industry or labour committees. The Regional Director plays a major role in balancing the demands of the functional program groups at the national level with the service delivery requirements, objectives and strategies of the regional and local level. The Regional Director must represent and understand the views of both sides. It is in this operational context that the Regional Director, Labour Program must orient the policy and service delivery frameworks for the Region's Labour Program. The position has the leadership role and challenge to realign the management and organizational structure of the Labour Program in the Region. Management and staff are currently located in various sites throughout the Region which makes it extremely difficult to provide coherent and knowledgeable line management for the total regional labour function and optimize the effectiveness of program delivery. Insufficient coordination of various labour program activities, such as inspections, client education and investigations, have the potential risk of excessive focus on one program area or client group, and inadequate service in other areas. The need for a balanced approach is a critical factor in discharging the legislative responsibilities. Failure to fulfill such responsibilities may result in an increased risk of disabling injuries or death, and exposes the department to potential liability. The Regiona! Director must develop priorities and objectives that emphasize the need to promote a fair, safe, healthy, stable and cooperative work environment for all workers and to create stronger ties with the provincial and territorial governments, business leaders, aboriginal associations and labour unions on operational issues such as safety and health, employment equity, and best practices. While actively pursuing legislative 6 II-Jan-O8
. Human Resources Development Canada @arve, where warranted, the position must also innovate within the existing Labour program legislative/regulatory frameworks through novel consuitative processes and the sharing of information, facilitating dialogue and developing increased awareness of employers, unions and employees of the needs and benefits of adaptation to new technology. The Regional Director, Labour Program, plans, organizes, coordinates, establishes priorities and develops and defines policies within which present programs will be delivered and future strategic orientations and business priorities and plans developed, and provides the leadership for the day-to-day assignment of responsibilities. The Regional Director is vested, either by Order-In-Council, or through identification in regulations pursuant to Parts II and III of the Canada Labour Code and the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act, with the authority to judge, permit or direct compliance with Code and/or regulations. This includes the problems of determining acceptable safety and health precautions, the circumstances in which prosecutions should be undertaken, and whether or not a complete shutdown of an establishment should be ordered. The Regional Director has the ability, experience and resources to direct diverse Labour programs with many different characteristics. In the process of coordinating the various aspects of the programs, the Director must consider outside factors such as Provincial and Industrial policies, economic concerns changing institutional features of Canada s industrial relations system, public awareness and demands, etc. These factors are having a considerable impact on the analytical and empirical methodologies implemented to define the appropriate response to the complicated and urgent request for assistance from the Program. The Regional Director is responsible for directing the provision of services and support to enable the Department to meet its mission objectives as they relate to occupational health and safety, labour standards, income maintenance for the injured, labour management relations and fire prevention within the assigned geographic zone. They are expected to provide advice and direction on all aspects of policy and programs under their jurisdiction in a continually changing environment, which require redesign and reinforcement of programs with consistent monitoring of their impact on regional and departmental goals. The Regional Director must ensure a cohesive approach to the internal management of the Program across the Region; approved HRSDC and Regional goals, strategic priorities, business plans and resource ceilings must be translated into the Program s operating circumstances and resource direction and allocation. This requires the incumbent to maintain a broad knowledge of government activities, provincial or territorial as well as federal, and Cabinet priorities to provide an acceptable level of service while remaining flexible enough to respond quickly to unforeseen developments within a context of limited resources. The Regional Director oversees the formulation, interpretation and maintenance of the Regional Labour Program's policies, procedures and working relationships with senior executives of provincial and/or territorial governments, private industry, Crown 7 II-Jan-O8

The effectiveness and efficiency of this program management requirement is highly dependent on the incumbent's ability to demonstrate a depth of program knowledge and significant problem-solving skills. The complexity of programs and problems requires extensive knowledge of the subject matter as well as adaptive thinking in broadly defined areas. A major challenge to the position is to develop strategic and policy concepts and assess, recommend, articulate alternative strategies for the Labour Program and the Region to pursue. This requires the continuing development of new approaches and the balancing of priorities to meet the expressed needs of diversified clientele located in British Columbia, Yukon Territory, Alberta and Nunavut jurisdictions. A further challenge is in determining acceptable safety and health precautions, the circumstances in which prosecutions should be undertaken and whether or not a complete shutdown of an establishment should be ordered. Decisions such as these require the balancing of the welfare of workers with those of social and economic well being of the community. The incumbent must be skilled at brokering or building consensus between the Region and the national Labour group as well as among provincial/territorial and municipal governments and a vast array of involved external organizations spanning the public and private sectors. The leadership and consensus and relationship building skills of the incumbent are key to moving forward on the federal agenda for the Labour portfolio. A difficult balance must be achieved with the dual roles of consensus building and the regulatory/enforcement aspect. Other challenges include the translation of legislative and policy directions into meaningful operational instructions that can readily be understood by the officers tasked with the implementation of programs in the Region. The Regional Director develops strategies and exercises personal judgement as to the most appropriate time to advise or to seek approval at a higher level, thus playing a major role in shaping the position of the Labour Program as it related to regional and departmental objectives. Contacts are maintained with Deputy Ministers and other senior staff of provincial and/or territorial governments, senior officials of private industry, unions, aboriginal organizations, employee associations, Crown corporations and the Public Service to define and discuss legislation and regulations and their interpretation. Contacts are also conducted with many of the above officials to resolve conflicts and discuss possible closures and other measures for non-compliance. Regular contact is maintained with the Regional Executive Head and the ADM, Labour and other officials of the department to present new policy proposals, changes in programs, legislation and regulations, and to discuss regional operational long term and strategic plans.

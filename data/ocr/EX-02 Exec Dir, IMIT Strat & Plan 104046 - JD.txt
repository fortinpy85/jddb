NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)'s mandate is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to help Canadians live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians quality of life. The Department supports Canadians throughout their lives, by assisting families with spending more time with their newborns, more high quality, affordable childcare options or simply more money to care for their children, helping students finance their post- secondary education, supporting unemployed workers and providing seniors with income security. ESDC is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission to strengthen the social foundations of the country. ESDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities related to the development of Canada's human capital. The Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) operates in a complex, multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder environment to develop and maintain the information technologies that underpin the delivery of socio-economic pensions, benefits and labour programs to Canadians. IITB ensures the department efficiently pursues their strategic, operational, and transformational agendas through sound, innovative. reliable, and secure IM/IT solutions and services. Of particular importance, IITB supports the management and evolution of the information technologies that underpin the operation of government's most important socio-economic programs, namely Old Age Security, Canada Pension Plan, and Employment Insurance, which delivers a combined I63 million payments to 8 million Canadians valued at approx. $II5 billion annually (estimated at 5.2% of Canada s GDP). The Executive Director, IM/IT Strategy and Planning leads the development of immediate and long-term information technology strategies that form the foundation for the development of solutions used to deliver services to Canadians, to administer and operate the department, and to support employees in their day-to-day activities. In this context, the Executive Director, IM/IT Strategy and Planning faces many challenges. Of particular relevance, ESDC continues to operate systems that were originally designed more than 5O years ago, and with information technologies that have not been replaced in 25 years. These systems were never designed to leverage the breadth of modern technologies available today. With so many IM/IT options available to ESDC, it is critical that the information technology decisions it makes today can be managed and sustained over the next I5 to 2O years. The Executive Director, IM/IT Strategy and Planning's primary role is to navigate through the maze of information technology choices and guide the department to the best alternatives for broad departmental IM/IT services and individual program needs. In addition, the use of IM/IT tools have become intrinsic to all ESDC employees. Employee desktop tools such as email, document management, and spreadsheets have become commonplace and critical to the fulfilment of employees day- to day jobs. More complex tools such as SAP for finance and materiel management and PeopleSoft for HR management are now imperative for running the department. The Executive Director, IM/IT Strategy and Planning leads the development of strategies for the adoption and evolution of IM/IT tools and services for the department The Executive Director identifies opportunities for IM/IT service enhancement and recommends IM/IT initiatives to program branches and senior management for increasing productivity and reducing costs. As it relates to meeting the needs of ESDC programs to Canadians, the Executive Director, IM/IT Strategy and Planning and his teams work in close collaboration with the program branch representatives to identify the technology solutions that best serves the individual project needs. All specific IM/IT strategy and planning activities are carried out by teams, led by subordinate directors and executed through employees or professional services resources, as required. The individual directors, and their respective teams, work closely with the program branch representatives, the IITB Business Relationship Management groups and the ITB Business Solutions groups to identify and understand the business requirements of individual ESDC branch projects or broader ESDC-wide initiatives. These requirements are analyzed to determine the business, operational, and technological conditions required to deliver the target services to Canadians, the Government of Canada, other jurisdictions, external organizations, or itself (in the case of internal IM/IT services). Once these requirements and conditions have been understood, the teams work with the IITB Architecture teams to narrow the technological design and formalize the architectural blueprint for the building and/or the purchasing of the required solution. The Executive Director ensures consultation with IM/IT officials of central agencies, other government departments, provincial governments and the private sector to ensure comphance with existing and planned {M/IT direction, leverage lessons learned from other comparable government projects, and maximize the knowledge and experience of these organizations. In some cases, the confirmation of individual strategies demands the execution of proof of concepts, and/or prototypes, of technology solutions to ensure that these solutions and technologies can meet ESDC s operational and security requirements, and can be successfully integrated within ESDC s information technology architecture. In these Page 2 of
cases, the prospective solution is installed in a laboratory setting, and the Executive Director manages stringent functional, technical, and business testing conducted by the lITB Business Solutions Teams. The Executive Director oversees these activities, in collaboration with the program branch representatives and the IITB Business Solutions group(s). In the scope of his responsibilities, the Executive Director participates jin the development of future national IM/IT direction, including legislative and policy changes or program and service improvement initiatives, by contributing to departmental and interdepartmental IM/IT committees, symposiums and seminars. Of highest importance, the Executive Director contributes to the evolution of the Digital Government policies and directives, the implementation of measures supporting the government's OneGC initiative, and the application of technology innovations, such as business intelligence, cloud services, and agile application development methodologies. The Executive Director also participates in intradepartmental planning committees to develop common government approaches, standards, and solutions. As a key example, the Executive Director will participate on the GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board, chaired by TBS, which evaluates digital investments and solutions to ensure the GC acts as a single enterprise by validating, recommending and approving technology solutions and to ensure departmental alignment with enterprise- wide IT standards, security, and strategic direction DIMENSIONS ETENDUE DES RESPONSABILITES Executive Director, IM/IT Strategy and Planning __ _. 7 : | Number of person years |Up to 75 full-time employees f L_Salary budget H$4.6M Cd O => | Annual Projects (3-year Projection | | Number of person years Up to 3O full-time employees : _ HUp to 5 contractors ___ Salary budget 82OM Cid Non-salary budget __ [$O.8M _ Ld Total number of person years [Up to IO5 full-time employees HUp to 3O contractors __ Total annua! budget [$9.3M Note : Impact of a system outage As an example, the information systems supporting El, CPP and OAS are at an increasing risk of failure. In fact, these systems have not been immune to outages in recent years: - In 2OI8, an outdated number format, built years ago into a CPP IT system resulted in a complete failure of the system until it was repaired. This outage directly impacted Canadians due to the inability to process all CPP workload for a full 24 hours, including the handling of client enquiries to the call centre. - In 2OI6, in an effort to gain efficiencies within the OAS system, a number of enhancements were implemented. Four days after implementation, it was discovered that the code was not behaving as intended and had to be tolled back to the prior version. The rollback and restoration of the data took another four days to complete, affecting OAS processing and service delivery. The changes incorporated simply went beyond the design of the system and caused unintended consequences. - Also in 2OI6, during the upgrade of the El mainframes, outdated code generated incorrect results when executed on the modern mainframes. The upgrades had to be halted for two weeks until an investigation was completed to locate any other instances of the problematic application code. The impact of such outages affect productivity, modernization efforts and in the worst cases, services to Canadians. For example, in the El processing cycles, the pay calculations are generated overnight and payments are issued before I pm the next day. This leaves little time to correct any errors that may occur with the pay processing cycles. Although infrequently, errors have occurred during the overnight processing hours that were not immediately corrected. The consequence is that all payments are delayed by a day, resulting in the late delivery of payments to 7O,OOO unemployed Canadians, valued at approximately $5O million. Page 3 of 5
The impact of a delayed OAS or CPP payment would be even more severe. For example, the large overnight batch processing cycle scheduled every month to produce OAS payments requires the execution of 325 batch jobs in a specific sequence in order to process the six million payments to Canadians, typically valued at over $4 billion. The execution of those batch jobs is carefully monitored by senior IT experts in order to ensure that no issues arise. Any system error need to be remedied during the processing window. Extremely knowledgeable resources are required to perform this role at all times SPECIFIC ACCOUNTABILITIES RESPONSABILITES PARTICULIERES : I. The Executive Director, IMT Strategy and Planning: a.

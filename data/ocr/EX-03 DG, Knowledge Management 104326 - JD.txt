Lead by four Ministers and six Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by supporting workforce development, fostering social inclusion, and addressing community needs. Service Canada, as the service delivery arm of ESDC, provides essential programs and services to millions of Canadians through multiple service channels. In response to the shifting needs of clients and the evolution of service delivery expectations, ESDC is undergoing a comprehensive transformation of its Service Delivery Network, which involves mobilizing a diverse workforce and aligning its operational structure to better serve Canadians in a fully integrated, omnichannel environment. The transformation, which began in 2OI6 with early preparatory work and implementation in 2O23, will continue over the next few years and will include significant technological innovations, such as the integration of the Curam platform for Old Age Security (OAS) and Employment Insurance (El). The Director General, Knowledge Management, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the necessary knowledge resources, tools, and systems are aligned with the goals of this transformation. By leading the development and integration of knowledge management practices into this transformation, the Director General ensures that Service Canada s workforce is equipped to deliver services efficiently, adapt to new technological and operational models, and meet the evolving needs of clients. 2
The transformation of the Service Delivery Network (SDN) has been driven by the need to address the fragmented nature of business expertise across the organization, which has led to functiona overlaps, inconsistent approaches, and missed opportunities for economies of scale. The Integrated Expertise Network Branch is tasked with addressing these challenges by aligning expertise, training, and knowledge management to enhance service delivery capabilities. It plays a pivotal role in Service Canada's transformation by integrating training, content development, and knowledge management functions to optimize operational efficiency and client service. The IENB ensures a seamless flow of relevant knowledge and resources, empowering staff at all levels with the necessary skills and information to deliver effective services to citizens. In the context of Service Canada's transformation toward a fully integrated omnichannel service delivery model, the role of the Director General, Knowledge Management (DG, KM) is of paramount importance. This transformation is designed to provide Canadians with a seamless, responsive, and efficient experience across various service channels, including digital platforms, in-person interactions, and call centers. It is in this context that the DG, KM is responsible for developing and implementing strategic knowledge management initiatives that directly support the integration of expertise, training, and knowledge resources to enable this transformation. By ensuring the alignment of KM strategies with evolving client service needs, the DG, KM contributes to optimizing both client experience and operational efficiency, ultimately leading to amore personalized and efficient service delivery model. The DG, KM plays a critical role in shaping Service Canada's transition to this new service model by overseeing the creation, maintenance, and integration of relevant knowledge and resources that support the workforce at all levels.

particularly complex in an environment where employees may have differing levels of familiarity with KM tools and resources, and where integration into daily workflows is key to success. Another challenge is ensuring the seamless integration of KM systems with other service delivery tools and platforms. As Service Canada moves toward a more integrated omnichannel model, the DG, KM must ensure that knowledge management solutions are not only functional but also well- aligned with the diverse technologies and service delivery channels in use, including digital platforms, call centers, and in-person services.

The DG, KM must manage diverse interests and ensure alignment between different divisions, government departments, and external organizations, all while addressing organizational needs, resource limitations, and service delivery goals. Achieving this alignment is essential for ensuring that knowledge management strategies remain consistent, scalable, and adaptable in a complex and evolving environment.

Furthermore, as Service Canada continues its transformation, the DG, KM is tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that knowledge management strategies not only align with current service delivery models but also anticipate and support future changes. This includes staying ahead of emerging trends in service delivery and client expectations, ensuring that knowledge management solutions are forward-thinking, scalable, and prepared for evolving technological and operational demands. Lastly, the position faces the ongoing challenge of ensuring that knowledge management practices contribute directly to the achievement of broader organizational goals, including enhanced client satisfaction and improved service delivery. By aligning KM initiatives with the evolving transformation of Service Canada, the DG, KM must continually drive performance improvements, leveraging data-driven insights and ensuring that knowledge resources are leveraged to optimize both service delivery and organizational efficiency. This role requires strong executive leadership and the ability to manage cross-functional teams through complex transitions, particularly in a knowledge-intensive environment. The DG, KM will need to balance resource and financial constraints while continu ously driving the integration of knowledge management practices that support Service Canada's transformation to a more digital - first, omnichannel service model. By establishing performance measurement frameworks and using data-driven insights, the DG, KM will continuously assess the effectiveness of knowledge 4

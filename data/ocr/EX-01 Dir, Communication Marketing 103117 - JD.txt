The mission is accomplished through the development of policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life s transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. HRSDC, through the Service Canada Initiative, supports Canadians and their communities by providing citizen-centered, quality service through a network of people partnerships and technology that helps Canadians access the full range of Government services and benefits. The delivery of Government services and programs is complex because of the broad scope of the programming involved, the number and diversity of the clients served and their needs, and the multiplicity of stakeholders and partners involved. Service Canada helps simplify citizen access to Government services and programs and increases the accessibility and ease with which those requiring GoC information and services may successfully obtain what they need, when they need it, and in a way that is convenient to them. Service delivery is based on four fundamental principles: ensuring access for all Canadians; developing an_ interactive relationship with citizens and communities; demonstrating service excellence; and providing a sustainable federal presence.

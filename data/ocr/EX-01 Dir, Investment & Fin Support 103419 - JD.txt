These initiatives required supporting activity in the area of systems and financial information. As a consequence, Treasury Board set in motion the Shared Systems initiative and the Financial Information Strategy (FIS). In addition to these centrally driven initiatives, SDC identified sustainable and effective program management and service delivery as one of four key results it would provide to Canadians. Included in this key result is a strong emphasis on modern comptrollership and accountability. SDC. as the major department responsible for the Government's labour market and social policy agenda, plays a key role in assisting the Government in achieving its overarching goal to build a stronger, ever more inclusive Canada and secure a higher quality of life for all Canadians. It's programs and services which include income security for seniors, persons with disabilities and their children, survivors and migrants; employment insurance income benefits; learning and skills development: Canada student loans; youth employment strategy: health and safety of federally regulated workplaces; and homelessness touch every Canadian, one day or another, often when they face difficult transitions in their lives. At $ 64 billion, SDC has the greatest expenditure on programs and services of any department. Much of the work and responsibilities associated with the centrally driven initiatives previously mentioned and SDC' s priority for a strong, effective and accountable organization have fallen upon the Policy and Corporate Management Systems Directorate (PCMS) within the Financial and Administrative Services (FAS) Branch of SDC. 2

NATURE AND SCOPE Empioyment and Social Development Canada (ESOC) is a large and complex Department that supports Canadians throughout their lives. The mission of ESDC's portfolio, which includes the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a strong and more competitive Canada, to . support Canadians tn making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve their quality of life. The Department delivers a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives through three business lines: program that support human resources and skills development, the Labour Program and Service Canada. The mission is accomplished through the development of policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources in order to participate in learning, work and in their communities. ESOC creates programs and initiatives to support Canadians as they move through the transitions of life and to create enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence in partnership with other departments and agencies and with other orders of government. The combined Portfolio workforce exceeds twenty thousand employees who are located in all regions of the country. The ESDC Portfolio operates within a complex govemance and accountability structure that supports the Minister of ESDC, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of State (Seniors) and a Parliamentary Secretary. ESDC is responsible for policy and program development and for the delivery of Government programs, services and benefits. To fulfill its mission, the Department is responsible for supporting a flexible, national labour market; increasing participation in the iabour . force; removing barriers to post-secondary education attainment and skills development, Overseeing federal labour responsibilities; providing income support to senior, families with children and Employment Insurance beneficiaries; and delivering Government of Canada (GoC) programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies. Included in these core roles ~~ "Rage 2 of II re
: are responsibilities for the design and delivery of some of the GoC s most well-known statutory Programs and services, including, Okd Age Security, the Canada Pension Plan; Employment Insurance, Canada Students Loans and Grants; the Canada Education Savings Program, the National Child Benefit, and the Universal Child care benefit. Labour Canada is responsible for overseeing federal labour responsibilities, including facilitating compliance with labour laws, occupational health and safety, and labour standards, as well as assisting trade unions and employers in the negotiation of collective agreements and their renewal in federally reguiated workplaces. The Program represents Canada in international : labour organizations and negotiates and implements labour provisions in the context of trade liberalization initiatives. Through Service Canada, the Department helps Canadians access programs, as well as other GoC programs and services, at more than 6OO points of service across the country. In addition to in-person services, the organization serves the needs of Canadians online, by telephone and its network of program-based call centres. Finally, through grants and contributions, the Department provides funding to other orders of government and organizations such as the voluntary and private sector, educators and community organizations to support projects that meet the labour market and social development needs of Canadians. ESDC will continue to evolve to achieve better results for Canadians while safeguarding taxpayers dollars. The Department's business transformation and modernization initiatives help the Department to reduce costs, enhance program integrity and improve service. ESDC will also be making improvements to policies and programs by updating program design and implementing new service delivery upgrades to meet the changing needs of Canadians. Finally, the Department is working to build a high-performing and adaptable organization by improving its management practices and its enabling infrastructure so that it can continue to meet Canadians Needs in the future The Department will continue to monitor risks associated with the implementation of the change agenda and their possible impact on the implementation of new initiatives, core programs and service standards These risks are driven by three main factors: the scope and complexity of changes; the impact of change on the Department's employees, and, most importantly, the cumulative risk of having such a high number of transformation activities being undertaken concurrently. ESDC will continue to rely on its mitigation and monitoring strategies, including enhanced monitoring by senior-level committees and through the continued implementation of the Information Technoiogy Services Model, Investment Plan, Workforce Management Strategy and National Learning Policy to identify and react to any escalating risks in a timely fashion. In addition, increased monitoring and reporting on various transformation initiatives will be undertaken to provide early indicators of areas requiring attention. This will make certain that public resources are used efficiently and effectrvely, and ensure that they are targeted to the highest level of departmental priorities to meet objectives. The portfolio nature of the Department, as well as the complex financial arrangements with other Federal departments and agencies, and with the Provincial governments. presents major challenges to IASB that are unique in the federal government. The challenges are those of individual mandates for each of the Portfolio organizations, the inter-departmental and inter- governmentai financial arrangements and the three distinct sources of funding (i.e. CRF. the Employment Insurance Account and the Canada Pension Fund Account). The diversity and visibility of Portfolio programs, services and benefits plus the magnitude of the expenditures involved (i.e. $IIO.3 billion annualty) and the size of the workforce (i.e. over twenty thousand) are further challenging factors that complicate the intemal audit function Rage Sof tt
In addition to strengthening the delivery of programs, services and benefits to Canadians. the : GoC has placed a priority on improving financial management through the Office of the Comptroller General (OCG). The OCG works to strengthen financial management and internal audit practices across the federal public service and thereby support the overall effectiveness of public administration in Canada, and provides functional direction to the internal audit function and to the CAE The Management Accountability Framework (MAF) for the GoC is a key performance management tool that the federal government uses to support the management accountability of deputy heads and, improve management practices across departments and agencies. MAF summarizes the vision behind various management reforms into ten high-level management expectations of deputy heads including, turning Governance and Strategic Directions into Results and Performance; promote a culture supported by strong Public Service Values, Learning. Innovation and Change Management, and stress Management excellence in the areas of Stewardship, Policy and Programs, Risk management, Citizen-focused Service, Accountability and People Management. The MAF articulates a set of government-wide expectations for sound management and establishes the framework of accountability for Deputy Heads to ensure that the conditions for good management are put into place . To that effect, the internal audit function is an essential component of the Department's management framework as it supports senior management in the effective discharge of significant responsibilities by providing independent and objective opinions and advice on the effectiveness and efficiencies of operations. IASB contributes to enhancing accountability and performance by assessing departmental risk management, control and governance processes to , ensure program targets, plans are aligned with departmental objectives and priorities; resources are acquired, used effectively, and adequately protected: management and operations are effective and efficient; risks are appropriately identified and managed: quality and continuous improvement are fostered in the departmental controt processes: financial, managerial, and operating information is accurate, reliable, and timely, with feedback to decision making mechanisms, compliance with policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations is achieved: and legislative or regulatory issues affecting the Department are recognized and addressed The Financial Administration Act (FAA) and the formulation of a new policy and directives aimed . at strengthening the overall internal audit function in support of more transparent and accountable government. The Accounting Officer model recognizes the Deputy Head in each Department as the accounting officer who is accountable to the House of Commons and the Senate. It also provides the Deputy Heads and the Comptroller General of Canada with the added assurance independent from tine management - on risk management, contro! and governance processes - (Le. the internal audit function). The T8 Poticy on Internal Audit (revised April I, 2OI2) contributes to the improvement of public sector management by ensuring strong, credible, effective and sustainable internal audit function within departments as well as government-wide. The Policy also provides a clear and integrated assignment of responsibilities for internal auditing between deputy heads and the Comptroller General. Internal audit is critical to effective and credible governance and for improving the independence, objectivity and overalt effectiveness of the function. it also reflects a more principles-based and risk management perspective. : Internal audit plays a significant role in terms of influencing management, contributing to change management, as well as driving change. In order to achieve this internal audit must develop robust strategies and plans, including an annual RBAP, programs and recommendations, which consider the size, complexity and diversity of ESDC's programs and operations. In addition, the sheer volume of transactions requires the Department to have a strong contro! framework in place to ensure stewardship of assets. Internal audit must ensure that the strategies put in place include assessments of the control frameworks (including financial) to contribute to minimizing Page 4 of II
. errors due to control weaknesses, which if not discovered could have significant cumulative impacts The last few years saw a significant amount of modemization and transition at the departmental level, due in large part to the Deficit Reduction Action Pian (DRAP) following the Strategic Review (SR). including several major transformations which were under way. For the near future. the reality remains one of modernization, transformation and adjustment in a context of financial constraints. As a result of the increase in the management, oversight and the upward and external requirements facing roles and responsibilities of the [ASB, there is a need for a position to play a senior advisor role to the CAE on issues of a horizontal nature and scope that are mission critical for the IA function Itis within this context that the Director, Liaison and DAC is responsible for the management of all external audit activities carried out within ESDC by the OAG. the central agencies (TBS/OCG/PSC/ /Privacy Commissioner of Canada/Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development) and other externa audit entities The Director provides the leadership for the management of all activities between the Office of the Auditor General, central agencies, ather external audit entities and the Department, relevant to the conduct of audits pertaining to HRSDC. The Director is responsible for supporting the Chief Audit Executive in debriefing the Minister.

To accomplish the above, the Director, Liaison and DAC, provides detailed analysis and advice to not only the CAE and Deputy Minister, but to senior management and statutory program management (CPP, Ei, OAS, CSLP, G&C, etc.) on both the specific (to the program) and the horizontal (to the department) implications of external audit observations and recommendations. This advice and analysis is critical as it ensures that the proper interpretations of facts are presented accurately in these external audit reports This enables parliamentarians, Canadians and the media to gain a proper understanding of the effectiveness and efficiencies of the departmental statutory programs and operations.

Given the significance of these audits, and the potential impact they can have on the Department, as a whole, the requirement to be well-prepared and ensure the participation of senior branch management at the appropriate intervals during the audit is critical to the success of these audits. The Director Is also responsible for addressing issues that may arise during the conduct of the audits to facilitate the work of the audit representatives. These issues can be from the perspective of the OAG, Central Agencies, other audit entities or from the perspectives of the audited Branch(es) / Region(s). The Director is instrumental in taking the initiative to bring together the various parties in order to expeditiously resolve the issues. This can require involving senior Branch management, including the Assistant Deputy Minister, and senior OAG Practice Leaders Page Soft
in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory solution. Resolving these issues in a timely manner is essential to achieving the established audit objectives. As the sole recipient of the draft chapters of all audit reports, and the focal point of contact during the various stages of the audit process, the Director is responsible for validating and challenging the accuracy and completeness of findings presented in the draft and final reports. The work requires leadership in conducting comprehensive analyses of findings to verify conformance between stated audit objectives and the findings and recommendations, to ensure validity and . felevance to the scope and objectives of audits. Where differing views and opinions are identified as a result of the analyses the Director firstly, identifies the issue at hand and provides advice to program management on the appropriate course of action. The Director also facilitates the bringing together of the external audit entities and Branch/Regional representatives to resolve the issues and ensure that complete and accurate findings are presented in the reports to enable this the director plays an interpretive role between the extemal auditors and program management to ensure that both sides have a clear understanding of the issues and the implications to the Department and Government of Canada. The importance of this role cannot be underestimated - because incorrect or ill-founded observations or recommendations, if ignored or left - unchallenged, could have serious negative consequences for the reputation of the Ministers, Deputy Ministers and the Department. Moreover, ill-founded recommendations, if implemented, , could have serious negative consequences for the efficiency or effectiveness of Departmental : operations The Director supports the CAE in debriefing the Deputy Ministers and Ministers on matters of significance in the draft chapters of all external audit reports. This is a key activity to ensure that the Deputy Minister is fully aware of all findings that could be critical of the Department's management and operations. could have substantial repercussions for the Department, and/or could be subjected to reputational, media, or public scrutiny. The objective is to ensure that the . Deputy Ministers and Ministers are fully informed and briefed on the findings and are able to . obtain relevant explanations from the appropriate Branches surrounding the significant findings, as well as the actions that are being taken to address them, so that the Deputy Minister, and Minister are in a position to respond to these matters, as necessary. The Director works closely with senior departmental officiats during all phases of the audit process and provides briefings on the progress of external audit activities. The Director : coordinates the development of responses and action plans by ESDC Branches/Regions to . address audit observations and recommendations, detailing the measures to be taken and the timelines for achieving the necessary actions.

The Director ensures debriefings incorporate recommended strategies to address potential negativity without compromising the legitimacy of the audit process. In the development of briefing presentations. the Director consults with the key executives of the concerned organizations to ensure their views are reflected and to develop resolution strategies that address the realities of the concerned organization as well as the broader environment and context of the Department. This involves consultations with senior departmental managers on the assessment of the quality of the audit a er
work and the accuracy of the findings by these external audit organizations. The key challenge is ; to influence the auditors from these central agencies to be receptive to ESDC 's response to their findings without challenging their professional approach or their professional independence. The . Director represents the departmental corporate position and responses at various meetings and consultations with senior OAG, CESD and OCG officials on audit issues. The incumbent directs activities to coordinate the preparation of corporate IASB briefing material whenever the OAG, CESD or OCG tables a report in Parliament The fact that ESDC is a multifaceted Department by reason of the portfolio nature of the organization and the complex financial arrangements it has with other Federal departments, agencies and Provincial governments, adds a significant dimension of complexity and challenge for the Director who must have a comprehensive understanding of the potential impact audits conducted by the OAG, Central Agencies and other external entities could have on the Department. As a consequence. the Director must be sufficiently knowledgeable of the Department's diverse business lines in order to represent the Department with the OAG, Central Agencies and other external audit entities, to be able to discharge such roles as validating the accuracy of audit findings, supporting the CAE tn briefing the Deputy Ministers on significant issues, preparing the Deputy Minister, and where required, the Minister for tabling of reports from : the OAG, Central Agencies and other Agents of Parliament and to work effectively with all external audit entities and the Branches throughout the auditing and reporting processes The Director develops implements and manages a process for the analysis of OAG, central agencies and other external audit entities audit reports to identify and assess the actual and . potential policy and operational implications for the internal audit program and functions of the Department.

3 NATURE AND SCOPE: The mission of Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive workforce, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development and delivery of policies and programs to promote a society In which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to enable Canadians to move through life s transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. Clients include individuals, businesses/employers, institutions and intermediaries, Provinces, Territories, other levels of government, including Aboriginal governments. The new Skills and Employment Branch was created in April 2OO7 and is the result of a recent integration of the former Employment Programs Policy and Design Branch, the former Workplace Skills Branch, the National Office of Literacy and Learning and a team responsible for the Opportunities Fund and Labour Market Agreement for Persons with Disabilities. The Branch contributes to enhancing competitiveness of Canadian workplaces and increasing labour force participation of unemployed and vulnerable workers through human capital and skills development; insuring lost employment income; reducing barriers for people seeking to enter or re-enter the labour market as well as investing in, recognizing and using skills, in and for the workplace; and creating opportunities for Canadians through training and mobility. The Director General, in collaboration with CIC and Service Canada, provides the context and operating frameworks for the Temporary Foreign Workers Program which seeks to improve the Canadian labour market by ensuring that qualified temporary foreign workers are admitted to work in Canada in jobs or vacancies that cannot be filled by Canadians. The Temporary Foreign Workers Program assists employers in hiring temporary foreign workers to fill labour shortages and bring new skills and knowledge to benefit the economy. The Directorate functions within a demand-driven environment which increases with the pressure from employers to address immediate skill shortages. This pressure is further complicated by the division of responsibility between the Department, Service Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), CBSA and provinces/territories. While the Directorate assesses employer applications based on whether there will be a positive, negative or neutral impact on the Canadian labour market, it is CIC that issues work permits for temporary foreign workers and the provinces/territories that legislates the protection of these workers while they are in the country. This necessitates building, strengthening and maintaining strong relationships between all these stakeholders in order to ensure that the mandate of the Temporary Foreign Workers Program is met. The Director General directs and leads HRSDC s contribution to the development of the Going to Canada Portal, and the maintenance of relevant labour market information. HRSDC is the federal lead with respect to labour market information, through the federal-provincial/territorial Labour Market Information Working Group which reports to the Forum of Labour Market Ministers (FLMM). The Director General also plays a leadership role in the research, provision and management of labour market information on a national scale in support of labour market transitions into and within Canada which includes forecasting national labour and skills supply and demand, devising new skills research methodology, developing a range of national products and tools, identifying conceptual gaps in the various national tools and databases, development of a wide range of information products and services and for improving the position of labour market information as a
4 responsive, fundamental platform for building skills, learning and innovation in Canada. The Director General is responsible for the management and oversight of HRSDC labour market information resources. This includes I4 different websites offering an array of products and services to Canadians, businesses and researchers. In addition, the Director General is responsible for the management of the National Job Bank. With a staff of 4O people, the Job Bank provides information to Canadians about available jobs, broken down by location and type of occupation. This responsibility extends to providing functional direction to some 2OO regional staff who gather and assess labour market information that is critical to the design and delivery of HRSDC programs, as well as supporting the mandates of a number of other departments such as CIC and Industry Canada. A major challenge for the future will be reviewing current investments, products and services with a view to strengthening the availability, relevance and timeliness of labour market information. This work will respond in part to the recommendations of the Drummond Report, but also address issues and challenges related to supporting the economic recovery and ensuring that Canadians and businesses have the necessary information to make informed decisions as the economy and labour market evolve. Recognizing the common interest but different responsibilities across jurisdictions, the Director General works closely with provincial counterparts to coordinate respective investments in labour market information collection, analysis and dissemination. A large part of this work is carried out through two FLMM working groups, but also requires building relationships with provincial counterparts to ensure constructive dialogue and collaboration. The Director General builds strategic partnerships and leads negotiations with other federal government and provincial/territorial organizational entities in order to align and coordinate program activities. This includes providing expertise and representation at various national Labour Market fora and working groups established by The FLMM and the Canadian Council for Directors of Apprenticeship where the Directorate works collaboratively with the provinces to achieve mutually agreed goals. The Director General must also ensure that the Directorate works collaboratively with Service Canada to fulfil the terms of the LMI Annex to the MOU between Service Canada and HRSDC which includes overseeing the development of performance indicators for the LMI function and the provision of foundational tools such as the NOC. In addition, the role of the Director General is to develop and implement a departmental wide vision for LMI, bringing together the elements of the business lines that are regionally delivered. The first challenge faced by the Director General is to establish the new Directorate within the context of the Branch, ensuring the integration, coherence and viability of the Directorate s strategic and business priorities and policy and program frameworks within the Branch s, HRSDC s and the Government of Canada s strategic human resources and skills development policy priorities and agenda. While establishing the new Directorate, the Director General s second challenge is to integrate a new division, the Skills and Labour Market Information group. The Director General ensures the integration and coherence of the diverse programs which have been transferred from their earlier settings into the New Directorate. The Director General must ensure that proactive transitional and change management strategies are in place. The Director General will lead the development of the Directorate s strategic and business plans, and operational policy, program/service delivery and governance frameworks for each of its diverse programs in the new context. This requires developing and implementing the
5 appropriate management structures, resource allocation approaches, and human resources strategies, and working to engage managers and staff in contributing to the new Directorate s vision and mission. The Director General must ensure that these frameworks fully reflect the constantly evolving environment of Federal-Provincial/Territorial partnerships and arrangements and international relationships. The Director General conceives, leads and directs the development of strong outreach and stakeholder engagement initiatives and activities to develop networks across the federal government, within HRSDC and with the wide range of national and international governmental, public, private and non-governmental sector organizations involved in this complex portfolio. The Director General is involved with the key federal partners, provincial/territorial ministries and an array of foreign governments in the consultative engagement strategy, as well as working with foreign governments such as Mexico and certain Caribbean countries to negotiate and maintain bilateral arrangements related to the flow of labour. These measures are essential to the evolution of the Directorate s programs. The Director General faces a significant challenge in engaging these partners in the development and sustenance of relevant program frameworks and the building of the required national infrastructures and networks, to achieve collaborative approaches and program orientations with these entities. The Director General s strategic approach will have direct impact on the achieving a highly skilled, inclusive pan-Canadian labour force that best utilizes temporary foreign human resource capital to meet Canada s current and future labour market requirements. To ensure an adequate knowledge base for national strategies, the Director General must assess existing studies of Canada s workplaces to identify gaps in current information on occupations and work performed in the various public and private sectors, which may adversely affect measures to attract temporary foreign workers to Canada. The assessment and remedying of such knowledge/skill gap or workforce shortages will require the Director General to lead collaborative action between the Directorate, Branch and department, foreign governments and NGOs, other federal and provincial departments/ministries, affected industrial sectors and voluntary organizations. The Director General, in delivering the assigned mandate and accountabilities, provides authoritative advice and briefing services to the Associate Assistant Deputy Minister, Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, the Deputy Minister and the Minister. This includes the co-development, with CIC and security agencies, of Memoranda to Cabinet and submissions to the central agencies and Cabinet concerning major program policy and delivery initiatives and strategies. The Temporary Foreign Worker program attracts significant media attention, and due to the high degree of stakeholder interest, both positive and negative, is very politically sensitive. The Director General is required to exercise judgement, making decisions about exceptions to program terms and conditions where warranted, and offering advice to the DM, Minister and political staff to manage pressures from external stakeholders. A key issue in the context of the current economic recovery is to balance growing demand for foreign workers with the goal of ensuring Canadians can return to the labour market. This requires close coordination with other HRSDC programs targeting training and supports for those displaced in the recession, to ensure that Canadians have the first opportunity to take available jobs. The Director General is a key contributor to the development of HRSDC s macro- economic strategies falling within the mandate of the Directorate, and is responsible for developing the department's program policy and service delivery response to reflect federal commitments and international obligations. The Director General
6 must apply a comprehensive understanding of the evolving positions and priorities of key external players including the central agencies and OGDs and a wide range of national private, public and voluntary sector organizations involved in, or affected by, the portfolio s policy and program mandate. Both the TFW program and LMI are essential to the effective management of the national labour market. The TFW program offers employers with the means to fill temporary skills and labour shortages, critical to the sustainability and profitability of many businesses and economic sectors. At the same time, TFWs can bring skills and training to Canadians, enhancing our capacity to innovate and compete on global markets. LMI is the primary means by which we are able to track both macro and micro changes in the labour market, and project labour and skills demand in the future. This is critical to the design, management and delivery of programs and services across government, as well as in provinces and territories. The Director General is responsible for ensuring that resources are invested effectively and that the services offered to Canadians and employers meet their needs and the goals of an efficient labour market. The impact and importance of decisions on both of these programs is high, and the sound management of these programs is in many ways critical to the effective management of the labour market. DIMENSIONS: FTE S: I55 Operating Budget: $I6.3 million The primary budget in 2OO9-IO for TFW directorate, including SLMI and Job Bank, is about $I6.3M in NHQ. The Director General is also responsible for the allocation of $28.3 million to regional offices that are responsible for program delivery. The Director General is also responsible for providing functional direction to regional staff, setting program priorities and providing guidance on the allocation of resources and program management. There are presently approximately 2OO, OOO temporary foreign workers in Canada, ranging from highly skilled professionals to lower skilled agricultural workers. They represent an important component of the labour force in Canada, with many key economic activities, such as oil sands development, depending on the availability of foreign workers to fill labour and skills gaps. As well, skilled foreign workers provide opportunities for training for Canadians, introducing new techniques and skills to improve our competitiveness and strengthen our economy.

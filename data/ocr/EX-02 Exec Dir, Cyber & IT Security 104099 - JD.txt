NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS ESDC, which includes Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Overseen by four federal Ministers, the Department operates under the direction the Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development; the Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development and Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada; the Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development; the Deputy Minister of Labour, and the Chief Transformation Officer. The Department provides a range of programs and services that support Canadians from seniors, unemployed workers, parents raising young children, and students needing assistance to finance their post-secondary education. The Department fosters inclusive growth by providing opportunity and assistance to Canadians with distinct needs, such as Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, homeless people and recent immigrants; oversees labour relations, occupational health and safety, labour standards, employment equity and workers compensation in the federal jurisdiction; delivers programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies, such as Passport services for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada IRCC), and to veterans on behalf of Veterans Affairs Canada. ESDC also designs and delivers a number of Government of Canada programs that provide benefits for Canadians, including Employment Insurance, Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, Canada Student Loans and Grants, Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program; the Wage Earner Protection Program; and more recently, the Canada Emergency Response Benefits provided to assist individuals and employers experiencing income loss/financial hardship due to the 2O2O global COVID-I9 pandemic. Executive Director, Cyber & IT Security Page 2 of 8 April Ist. 2O2I
Service Canada delivers many of ESDC 's programs and services through its integrated national service delivery infrastructure which serves as the primary point of contact for persons seeking information or to access Government of Canada services and benefits. Services are provided online via the Internet, through Service Canada s Specialized Call Centres, and at more than 6OO points of service across Canada. This includes some 32O+ in-person centres, 239+ scheduled out-reach locations, and 32 Government of Canada passport offices. Service Canada continues to grow and build its capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for services, in particular through strategic partnerships with other levels of government and community service providers where services can be consolidated to achieve cost economies and better serve local communities. The scale of Service Canada s national benefits delivery services network will continue to grow, due in part to Canada s changing demographics and aging population, and as additional points of service are brought on board to provide access for Canada s more isolated Northern, remote and rural communities. Recognizing the increasing demand and need to make services more accessible, the Department has committed to build a digitally enabled technology environment where clients will be able to access government services using their mobile devices and other electronic devices from anywhere, at any time, and through the platforms of any of its trusted partner. IT is a critical regulatory and transactional platform for the Department, and its significance as an enabler for delivery of common services across the Government of Canada will continue to grow. Even intermittent failure of IT functions has the potential to seriously impact business dealings and stakeholder engagements both within the Department, and between the Department and its diverse clients. Effective management of the Department's IT regime, therefore, provides the critical foundation to support the achievement of the Department's mandate. IT Security is a key enabler for achieving well-managed information in support of programs, business priorities and operations. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is essential to government decision making and the delivery of services. Effective IT Security requires a systematic approach that identifies and categorizes information and associated assets, assesses risks and implements appropriate safeguards, and establishes clear information technology security accountabilities. The Government has an opportunity to lead the way when it comes to digital innovation to support more widespread adoption of digital tools, and to better serve Canadians. The adoption of digital technologies in government harnesses the potential to improve the ways in which businesses can access public services, This complements the government's work on the Government of Canada's Innovation Agenda, to ensure Canada is a leader in the global innovation race, developing new pertinent skills, experience and technologies to foster the creation and development of fast growing companies. The rapid evolution and increasing adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in recent years has raised the expectations of citizens and businesses regarding their interactions with government. In order to meet these expectations, ESDC and the Government of Canada aim to modernize their public service offerings through digital, client-centric means, striving to achieve greater convenience to citizens and businesses through services that are easier to use, save time, reduce transaction costs, increase operational efficiency, and leave no-one behind. These initiatives have a major impact on development and delivery of an effective IT Security program. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) offers a unified approach to cyber security that will build on Canada's cyber security expertise. It centralizes cyber innovation and collaboration for the country where private and public sectors work side-by-side to solve Canada's most complex cyber issues. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security is a single unified source of expert advice, guidance, services and support on cyber security for government, critical infrastructure owners and operations, the private sector and the Canadian public. It enables faster, better-coordinated, and more focused Government responses to cyber threats and quicker, more effective information flow between the Government and private sector partners. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security provides a clear national point of contact for authoritative cyber security advice and assistance. Shared Services Canada provides infrastructure support to ESDC, hence a key success factor in delivering Executive Director, Cyber & IT Security Page 3 of 8 April Ist. 2O2I
on the IT Security mandate is close coordination with CCCS and SSC. Within this challenging and dynamic environment, the Executive Director, IT Security directs the development of the Department's IT Security Plan, and IT Security components of corporate, strategic and business plans relating to IT that ensure the effective management of the security of information, related IT assets and services. The Executive Director provides departmental leadership to ensure the IT Security Program employs continuous security monitoring and risk management to support the effective and efficient delivery of IT services and processes, and is consistent with Government of Canada policies, directives and standards. The role of the Executive Director requires Departmental collaboration with key internal services and program branches, with a specific need to coordinate incident response and investigations with Integrity Services. The role of the Executive Director in this regard is not constrained to the Department, but has Government-wide impact, due to the provision of a vast array of services to other government departments and agencies, all of which are dependent upon secure IT networks and services. This role is especially important due to the increased interconnectivity of IT systems and provides a strong foundation to ensure security of the Department's overall operations. The Executive Director directs the development and implementation of the Department's IT Security Program and associated risk assessment and risk management; provides IT Security input into systems and applications life cycle management; and ensures the safeguarding of all IT assets. This includes access to infrastructure, applications, systems, users and internet facing programs and systems, and managing increasingly complex systems as the digital ecosystem evolves. The Executive Director directs the development and implementation of the Department's IT security policies; encryption standards to enable each packet of data being transmitted over both public and private networks to be secured end to end; and governance structure, including decision making protocols for incident management, which ensure operational security and risk mitigation over the totality of the network. The Executive Director also directs development and implementation of IT security policies, standards and procedures for products and services provided by the Department to its public service clients, and governing associated contracting and procurement agreements undertaken with private industry. As the demand for more interconnectivity grows, increasing emphasis on digital security becomes essential to secure systems, ESDC s products and services serve many government Departments and as such, it is vital that they are secure out of the box" due to their interconnectivity with existing systems. The Executive Director provides expert IT Security advice and support to the development of these products and services. Thousands of IT security controls are defined by CSEC in order to ensure a uniformly high standard for encryption and IT security across government. The Executive Director determines which controls and standards are pertinent to a given situation; directs monitoring exercises to ensure security in applications and systems development, operations and administration functions; and provides associated expert IT security advice and oversight to service providers. The Executive Director also directs continuous software monitoring of user and network activity using cyber assessment software. This is to ensure that no malicious cade is being run on the network and to monitor for any potential breaches or data exfiltration. It is also done to assess the effectiveness of the IT Security Program and to achieve an acceptable level of risk. Monitoring and assessment results inform departmental authorities of the current state of the departmental information systems security posture. In the case of identified security problems and events, the Executive Director leads the conduct of investigations to identify and resolve them in accordance with incident management processes. The Executive Director directs the renewal of the departmental IT Security program in alignment with the GC's digital transformation and cyber security agendas, directs the development of associated budgets and plans, and secures funding for IT Security Program renewal.

The Executive Director provides leadership to internal IT security audits, as well as preliminary risk assessments of IT Security. The Executive Director directs the planning of the scope of internal audits as well as the methodology to be used to ensure the security of departmental systems. Regular audits are essential to identifying risks and issues in departmental IT Security that can be exploited by malicious actors to the detriment of secrecy and privacy, or interrupt regular operational activities. The Executive Director is also the point of contact in the Department for external security audits, and ensures auditors have the resources and access they require to identify risks and issues. The Executive Director directs the development of plans, new operational methods and policy, or upgrades necessary to secure systems based on the results of the audits. The Executive Director directs research into the impact on IT security of new technology, including the impact of the Government's digital innovation and open government agendas, and increases in electronic service delivery to the public and other levels of government. This includes such issues as service provision through the Internet, electronic commerce, the transfer of public funds, electronic authorization and authentication, electronic data interchange. The Executive Director advises senior management on capabilities, availability, costs and benefits of !T Security proposals and alternatives in this ever changing environment. The Executive Director also directs research and development of ESDC s cyber security policy to support innovation in departmental offerings and the security of existing systems. The Executive Director establishes strategic linkages with other government departments and other sectors when needed to ensure ESDC's cyber-security policy and related policy take into consideration stakeholders viewpoints, as well as security concerns, and to ensure that cyber security objectives are reflected in all departmental Memoranda to Cabinet where appropriate. The Executive Director directs the development and implementation of a security awareness program for ESDC to enhance employee knowledge and attitudes regarding the protection of the physical and informational assets of the organization. This includes the development and delivery of security awareness training and security awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and information systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, the Executive Director directs the development of delivery of security related training specifically tailored for the duties of enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers, acquisition/procurement Officials, information system managers, system/network administrators, personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level software. The Executive Director supports the development, implementation and management of the Branch's Business Continuity Plan (BCP), and provides a challenge function to other Branches BCPs to ensure the solutions described in their plans are viable, effective and supportable. The Executive Director has the responsibility to require the Branches to change their plans if a determination is made that they are not viable. Due to the high visibility of departmental programs (for example, the issuance of pensions and benefits to Canadians) this role is vital to the Department's credibility with its clients and with Canadians. There are several challenges for the position. The first stems from the overall cyber environment. The push to integrate more systems and services to realize the advantages that networked systems and information sharing offer, brings with it more serious consequences in the event of a data breach. Networking allows for a significant reduction in cost due to increased efficiency as well as more transparency. This represents a major challenge for the position, as increased interconnectivity introduces more complexities which increase the number of vectors for attackers to breach systems and networks. The Executive Director must ensure that Open Government initiatives that demand this integration to fulfill their mandates are as secure as possible without sacrificing usability. The Executive Director must work closely with departmental service providers and external partners to facilitate this and ensure the security of networks and data to allow for realization of the full array of benefits that systems integration can provide. This challenge is exacerbated by the role of the Executive Director in ensuring IT security of the Department's vast array of Government-wide Executive Director, Cyber&ITSecurty PageSoh April tst. 2O2I
services, requiring the position to have an in-depth knowledge of all departmental programs and activities and their interactions with client departments, and supportive IT systems and operations. Connecting computer systems brings with it significant advantages when It comes to leveraging processing power available government wide. Distributed systems allow for computers to be linked together to reduce infrastructure costs and increase the efficiency of operations. This represents a challenge for the position as connections between these computers must be both secure and reliable to ensure the integrity of data as well as the security of the overall network. This challenge is exacerbated by the complexity and the need to ensure compatibility of the systems that make up the network. The Executive Director must ensure the security of the wider network without compromising accessibility and usability. Increased collaboration and information sharing and the challenges they bring from a cyber security standpoint necessitates a more client focused approach to IT security. This necessitates building a more business focused IT security approach which facilitates clients needs and helps them achieve their goals while still being mindful of security concerns which can affect the integrity of systems, data, privacy and overall operations. Implementing this change in culture represents a challenge for the position as older methods may not conform to this new reality. The cyber security environment is a constantly evolving and rapidly changing one. New technologies, software and the increased interconnectivity of the world enable both new capabilities but also can open up new areas to exploit existing systems. Maintaining a current knowledge of the cyber security landscape is essential to having secure systems. Staying abreast of the latest developments and ensuring that policy, procedures and networks covers evolving variables is a constant challenge for the Executive Director. The Executive Director represents the Department on central agency and inter-departmental committees on cyber security. The Executive Director supports the Director General and ClO, providing expert briefings to help inform these bodies on privacy, access, and complex digital security issues. The Executive Director also represents the Department with the DG, or as an alternate to the DG, on government cyber security committees, CSEC, SSC and the TB Secretariat to exchange information and provide departmental input to align government-wide practices. Within the Department, the Executive Director supports departmental governance and operational committees.

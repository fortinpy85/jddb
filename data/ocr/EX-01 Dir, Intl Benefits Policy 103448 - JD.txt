NATURE AND SCOPE Income Security Program Branch s mission is to help Canadians during life transitions through the responsible administration and delivery of Canada s public pensions, the Old Age Security (OAS), including the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and the Canada Pension Plan Programs (CPP). ISP is the largest federal government program involving 5 million beneficiaries and I5 million contributors. Close to 5O% of Canadian seniors rely on ISP pensions as their main source of income. ISP also administers 45 international social security agreements. Approximately $5O Billion will be paid in OAS and CPP benefits for 2OO4-2OO5: $28 Billion for OAS Pensions, Guaranteed Income Supplement and Allowances; and $23 Billion for CPP Retirement Benefits, Disability Benefits, and Death, Survivor's & Children s Benefits. ISP delivers these programs through 4OOO staff, I,3OO located in headquarters and 2,7OO located in IO regional offices across Canada. The Policy and Legislation Directorate (Client Champion: Seniors) is responsible for the development and implementation of an income security and seniors policy agenda; the development and management of socio-economic research and analysis; the development and implementation of OAS and CPP program objectives, program policies, and interpretation, legislative and regulatory frameworks; support and coordination of Client champion activity; national outreach and client engagement activities; development of ISP's FPT plan; the development and implementation of a strategic plan for negotiating international Social Security Agreements; international policy and the development of networks and partnerships across government and with provinces, territories; stakeholder groups and international organizations critical to the success of ISP and the ability to support the Minister, DM and ADM. The ISP branch has been under considerable pressure since the creation of the department to support the department and government's efforts to articulate an agenda for seniors that is linked to, but goes beyond, income security. The rapidly aging Orr International Benefits Policy Oraft 5-O8-O4 Page 2 of 6
population and concurrent decreasing ratio of workers to retirees is putting considerable strain on public pension schemes around the world. As a result, many countries are opting for the development of private sector models which may minimize the protection of the most vulnerable members of society. Canada has a vital role to play in influencing the international social security agenda, in keeping with the government's priority to bring distinctive Canadian values to international affairs (Speech from the Throne, January 2OO4). In addition, significant progress has been made to improve existing public pension models, especially in the northern European context. Improvements or adjustments to the Canadian model require comprehensive comparative analysis in order to bring these best practices to fruition. In this context, the Director, International Benefits Policy requires leadership and communication skills to lead the Division in the negotiation of social security agreements that co-ordinate the Old Age Security program and the Canada Pension Plan with the comparable programs of other countries and to provide advice and support to the Branch (including functional direction to the regions) on any service improvements relating to the immigrant and emigrant communities of Canada. In addition, the Director applies a strong program knowledge and skill in the developing a strategic plan for the development and negotiation of International Social Security Agreements; implementation of Agreements, Memorandum to Cabinet; briefing materials for the ADM, DM, SDC Policy Committee(s) and the Minister; the development and implementation of appropriate consultative strategies and processes including those with the Department of Finance, PCO, other Departments, Provincial and Territorial Governments, and stakeholders. The Director must exercise functional authority for the national delivery of programs to ensure integrity and consistency in the delivery of the programs and services delivered to beneficiaries across Canada as a result of international Agreements. In light of the new mandate of Social Development Canada and its expanded focus on seniors and persons with disabilities, the Director is also responsible for leading the international comparative research and policy development of the Branch. In doing so, the Director provides leadership in undertaking international comparative research and international policy comparisons on income security and retirement systems, to inform and influence the domestic policy agenda for Income Security Programs. The Director also provides strategic research and guidance in identifying pension reform and policy requirements from a global perspective. The Director provides strategic vision, leadership and direction in the conceptualization, development and implementation of International Income Security policy, client-service charter and client-centred strategic and business policy, program and operating frameworks as they relate to the entitlements conferred by the International Agreements. The Director provides authoritative, strategic advice and recommendations to Orr International Benefits Policy Draft 5-O8-O4 Page 3 of 6

The Director represents ISP at the International Social Security Association and participates and disseminates relevant information on the public pension administrations of other countries. A significant management challenge for the Director is to transform an organization that has been traditionally operationally focused to one that has the capacity to think strategically, conduct comparative analyses, negotiate agreements and provide policy input.

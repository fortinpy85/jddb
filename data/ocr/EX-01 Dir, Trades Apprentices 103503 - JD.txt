NATURE AND SCOPE Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) is a key pillar, within the new l ,
government structure, policy agenda and service delivery context for achieving the Governments goals to build a 2Ist century economy for Canada and to strengthen Canadas social foundations. HRSDC provide leadership and a focal point for federal economic, labour market and social programs and activities relating to: the development of Canada s human capital: the promotion of an efficient labour market, including new federal-provincial/territorial labour market frameworks; the leadership and promotion of workplace skills development, including stronger linkages and partnerships with employers; enhanced access to post secondary education; the value of lifelong learning; the delivery of all income benefits through the national service delivery network's in-person service channel: and the regulation, fairness and health and safety of Canadian workplaces. The department is also accountable for developing shared strategies and programs with partners and stakeholders to alleviate homelessness in Canada. The department. with over I4,OOO employees. administers over $I8 billion in spending including the Employment Insurance Part | and II income benefits, student loans, and various funding programs related to labour market inclusion, employability, skills and workforce development, lifelong learning, literacy and specific client groups, such as Youth, Aboriginal, and Official Languages Minority Communities. HRSDC has a broad mandate to examine approaches to strengthen Canada's economic, labour market and social foundations and to establish new partnerships to create strategic approaches to respond to the emerging economic and labour market needs of Canadians. This involves an agenda to create new strategic and program policies and services/benefits to provide clients with the opportunities and tools to achieve their full potential and participation in the labour market and the community, and to share in, and benefit from, Canada's prosperity. The Workplace Skills Business line involves five major spheres of activity and accountability: Human Resources Partnerships (including: Sector Council Program: Foreign Credential Recognition, National Occupational Classifications and Essential Skills; Mutual Recognition Agreements, Trades and Apprenticeship), Foreign Worker Program and Labour Market Information. These are designed to support federal efforts for the economic and social development of all Canadians and to their participation in the workplace. Human Resources Partnerships (HRP) role will take on increased significance due to the increased emphasis on intergovernmental and government-stakeholder partnerships across all levels of government. This work is essential in order to enhance interprovincial worker mobility and to attain truly national accreditation and apprenticeship programs such as the Red Seal program and other mobility initiatives. At the same time, the existing Labour Market and Employment information products (e.g. the National Job Bank) and their respective management processes, systems and practices have been adapted to the directions and priorities of the new department. The Human Resources Partnership (HRP) Directorate supports these activities by conducting national sectoral studies to provide information on public and private sectors, their work activities and performance, knowledge and skill sets and other human resources development issues, and to identify current. medium and long term employment opportunities. These studies also identify current gaps in information on occupations and work performed in the various public and private sectors and critical human resources and knowledge/skill gaps or workforce shortages requiring collaborative action between the department, other federal and __ provincial departments/ministries, affected industrial sectors and involved public and voluntary sector organizations.
The knowledge and information determined through sector studies and national occupational and human resources research projects facilitates the establishment of Sector Councils and influences and enhances the reorientation and relevance of the national education, learning and training systems, and the conduct of major apprenticeship and other Interprovincial employment mobility and standardization undertakings. Similarly the Sectoral and Apprenticeship activities are key sources of data and information for the National Occupational/Skills Information program and trigger constant updates to the National Occupational Classification and JOBSCAN systems. The synergy between these three pillars provides an approach not only to describe and analyze skill requirements and gaps, productivity levels, career opportunities and human resources development issues and practices in Canada, but also encourages and supports strategies to upgrade skills and inform Canadians of career and educational choices and employment opportunities. Within the HRP Directorate, the Director, Trades and Apprenticeship is the focal point for managing the apprenticeship pillar, administering the national Red Seal program, and providing leadership and support to national bodies (e.g. the Canadian Apprenticeship Forum and the Construction Sector Council) to enhance the national understanding of skilled trades and apprenticeship issues, and to promote apprenticeship at the national level and with industry. The Apprenticeship pillar has three major objectives: I) to promote the Interprovincial mobility of workers by removing artificial barriers; 2) to expand national apprenticeship programs to cover more professional and trade occupational groups and work, and ensuring they include Aboriginals, youth and other marginalized or at risk social groups; and 3) to address Pan- Canadian human resources development issues by encouraging provinces and territories to work with each other, the private sector and the federal government. The Red Seal program is the primary national vehicle for achieving these objectives. The program includes the planning and conduct of national occupational analyses for selected trades in order to gather the intelligence and knowledge required to serve as the base to develop national skill, Knowledge and examination standards. The Director is responsible for working with the provinces, territories and their education and human resources systems to obtain national agreements on the standardization and acceptance of apprenticeship training and certifications (via the Red Seal program) to enhance their national employment mobility and remove artificial barriers. The Director also works with a range of academic, provincial/territorial and other partners and stakeholders (e.g., Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship, private sector business and labour organizations) to develop and implement apprenticeship programs for selected industrial sectors to deal with specific human resources development issues. The Director formulates integrated national program policy and service delivery frameworks to align the Division's activities with external and internal clients, including input to the Directorate's overall marketing, communications and financial management strategies. Such frameworks are essential for coordinating initiatives and approaches with the other Divisions and to ensure that the Red Seal program and other apprenticeship initiatives are consistent with the Directorate's vision and policy/program array. Within the context of the new HRSDC structure, the Director faces a further challenge in consulting with Regional Executive Heads to ensure that Red Seal and other program policy frameworks take into consideration the interests and positions of all I3 separate jurisdictions involved, to ensure the fullest possible harmonization at the national level.
The Director ts also required to understand and assess the current and evolving positions and priorities of key external players. These include the central agencies and OGDs (notably Industry Canada), and a wide range of national private, public and voluntary sector organizations involved In, or affected by. the portfolio s policy and service delivery (e.g.. the education and labour market ministries of provincial and territorial governments, industry, labour organizations, academic institutions, aboriginal associations, NGOs, etc.) A fully national perspective is essential, in order for the Director to advise the DG. ADMs/REHs and other HRSDC officials on trade and apprenticeship policy orientations, program delivery, and intervention strategies directed to specific trades, industries or regions. The Construction Sector Council represents about 88O,OOO workers in 45 regulated trades, with fourteen different unions. The construction trades alone represent about 6O% of overall Red Seal program activity, and the demand for skilled labour is increasing constantly. The Director provides secretariat and support services to the Council in such areas as: business, financial and operational planning: key sector/occupational/work data; consultation and business models; consensus building; dispute resolution; secretariat requirements: internal and external communications: promotion and marketing. These are provided to assist the Council act self-sufficiently, and assume ownership for the delivery of its own human resources development monitoring, training, evaluation and development activities. The Director also monitors the actions of the Council, and directs the provision of services (e.g., major occupational, cross-sectoral, career development studies) required for the operations of the Council. The Director plays a similar leadership and support role with the Canadian Apprenticeship Forum and other sector councils involved with skilled trades, and is responsible for promoting effective linkages with the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship (CCDA), the national body through which work on mobility is conducted. In addition, the Director is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the Training Centre Infrastructure Fund ($25 million over 3 years) which provides federal, labour and industry funding for the purchase of new equipment for skilled trades training. This responsibility includes developing the related Memoranda to Cabinet and Treasury Board submissions. and the delivery of the TCIF to ensure maximum leverage of public and private sector resources. The Director provides authoritative briefings and advice to the DG, ADM and other HRSDC officials on the broad range of apprenticeship issues, and represents the Department (and the Government) on the CCDA, the CAF, and at national/international conferences on trades and apprenticeship.

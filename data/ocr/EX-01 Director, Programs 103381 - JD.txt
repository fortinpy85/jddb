EXECUTIVE GROUP JOB DESCRIPTION POSITION TITLE: Director, Program Delivery. Office for Disability Issues BRANCH: Human Resources Investment DEPARTMENT: Human Resources Development Canada LOCATION: National Headquarters CLASSIFICATION: EX-I EFFECTIVE DATE: March 24. I998 POSITION No.: 7954I SUPERVISOR'S POSITION No.: O258O NATURE AND SCOPE The Minister of HRDC is also the federal Minister Responsible for People with Disabilities and as such it is imperative that the department provide him/her with the strongest policy and program advice and support in fulfilling federal leadership and departmental commitments and obligations to Canada s disabled people (i.e, I6% of Canadians have disabilities). The Minister has recently announced the government's intent to rebuild Canada s social development framework with an emphasis on investment in people as a means to end dependency and create hope, as these are considered to be key for Canada s social and economic renewal. HRDC is committed as part of this new social policy orientation to developing and implementing program policy and program/service delivery activities for disabled people that include: assisting people with disabilities to achieve self- sufficiency, independence and full participation in the mainstream of Canada s economy and society: identifying and focussing national effort to remove physical. attitudinal, systemic and other barriers that affect the equitable participation of people with disabilities in society and the economy: building or strengthening the capacity of communities and other service providers (e.g.. NGOs. national voluntary sector groups, private sector entities. etc.) to enhance their interface and support to disabled people; increasing investment in knowledge. creativity and enhanced information products and services at the local level which will enable people with disabilities to make informed and sound decisions on their socia! and economic futures and to more effectively manage social and economic transitions. including the shift to the knowledge-based society and economy While this range of program policy and delivery initiatives is of major consequence and complexity, the challenge of attaining them is further heightened by the government's program management priorities such as the need for: increased innovation to improve service delivery. significantly reduce HRDC s expenditures and to contribute to deficit 7
control. greater responsiveness to the interests of clients. stakeholders and partners and their strong and proactive involvement in policy and program development; and new fiscal and service delivery arrangements/partnerships with the provinces and new alternative service delivery mechanisms. An additional complexity is the continuing government resource restraint regime and the need for enhanced value-for-money and returns on federal investments in policies and programs Within this context the Director is accountable for: providing corporate leadership to coordinate. focus, integrate and advance HRDC s national vision, priorities and program policy and service delivery frameworks for the national disability issues portfolio: promoting the portfolio s profile within HRDC and the federal government and gaining more prominence for disability issues on the respective agendas of HRDC. the central agencies and key OGDs: establishing. or brokering. partnerships to advance the government's agenda with clients. stakeholders and partners. and providing authoritative advice within government and representational and educational services to general and targeted publics. Due to the Minister's lead federal responsibility for the promotion of equitable participation for disabled people, the incumbent has a particular challenge to make HRDC a model for the treatment and integration of disabled people that will enhance its credibility within all levels of government and with external clients. stakeholders and partners at the domestic and international levels. The Director establishes strong internal partnerships and information/consultation networks with HRDC s corporate Branches and Regions and the DMs and Ministers Offices. These are hey to gain the active input, and to identify the positions and priorities, of these key players which must be factored into: the development of national program policy. service delivery. performance measurement and accountability frameworks; and to the formulation of strategies and mechanisms related to their optimal operational implementation at the regional and local/community levels. This is essential to ensure coherence in these frameworks and consistency in the level of HRDC s performance in delivering services to disabled people across Canada. A key challenge for the incumbent in developing these frameworks is to assess their cost- effectiveness. affordability within the current fiscal context, and their ability to provide acceptable service levels to Canada s disabled people while not placing unrealistic program and financial stresses on HRDC in the future. The networks established also assist the Director in promoting and advocating the portfolio s priorities and objectives across HRDC and tn initiating innovative pilot projects on policy and program issues in collaboration with corporate Branches and Regions. This applies to domestic issues such as the design of new services under the Service Delivery Network to ensure the equal provision of services to disabled people. and to international initiatives such as the development of a marketing strategy of. and for. people with disabilities (e.g.. promotion of Canada s rehabilitation capacity). These networks also facilitate the development of national plans required to respond to the objectives and priorities stemming from major policy reviews and Cabinet direction (e.g., the recent Scott Task Force on Disability Issues and ensuing Cabinet priorities) 2
A key element for the development and implementation of the national program policy and detivery frameworks is the need for extensive and transparent consultation with major external clients. stakeholders and partners. including the central agencies. OGDs. NGOs. other public, private and voluntary sector and community organizations This ensures the optimal horizontal coordination among federal and provincial departments and the active involvement of these key stakeholders and partners in the national disability issues portfolio At the federal level, the Director promotes the portfolio to strive to harmonize the central agencies and OGDs' priorities. policy and program directions. strategies and associated resource effort for federal disabled peoples programming with HRDC s agenda. including leading major Task Forces and Working Groups or collaborative/ partner initiatrves. The incumbent must project the department's stance and positions in a dynamic. reasoned and persuasive manner in order to establish and to assume a leadership role and to advance HRDC s and the Minister's priorities for the portfolio. The development of partnerships is a main activity for the Director as they extend the portfolio s outreach and its resource allocations and enhance the free exchange of information and knowledge that benefits all parties involved in the disability issues portfolio. They are also effective mechanisms to promote federal and HRDC disability issues priorities and objectives and to facilitate the development of national consensus and strategies that will govern the future orientation and direction of the actions of all involved organizations to promote the equitable participation of disabled people in Canada s society and economy As the corporate leader for HRDC s disability issues portfolio. the Director is continuously involved in addressing issues that arise across the department and in helping the Regions and HRCCs to develop and implement appropriate strategies and operational responses. Similarly the incumbent drives the process, often in collaboration with other HRDC organizations and external organizations, to develop new and innovative information and knowledge products and services for delivery at the national. regional and local level. These initiatives transform and strengthen the capacity of the local offices to provide the optimal service for the portfolio and also enhance the capacity of community organizations and of disabled Canadians and their families to make better decisions concerning social and economic development. Associated with this function is the responsibility to develop and implement comprehensive public education and information plans and activities that raise general and target publics awareness of disability issues, and of the national infrastructure of public. private and NGO organizations that exist to provide services and assistance These initiatives promote support by all sectors of society for federal priorities and enlist their effort in implementing strategies and actions to eliminate barriers and to enhance the full participation of people with disabilities in society. the workforce and the economy.

The incumbent, as a recognized expert in the federal government for the disability issues portfolio is often requested by external partners and stakeholders to provide them with expertise and assist them in developing solutions to policy and program issues. Given the government's and HRDC s priority for extensive consultation with clients. stakeholders and partners on program policy and delivery design and development, and the need for a convergence of social and economic policy, many of the policy initiatives lead by the Director will involve multi-disciplinary, intra- and inter-departmental, intergovernmental and federal-client group Task Forces or Committees. The incumbent will usually lead. or play a major role for, such initiatives given HRDC's recognized expertise and capacity in this area of Canadian public policy. These consultative initiatives pose a major challenge to the Director as he/she must be able to: lead them in such a way as to gain agreement on the approach to be followed and on the scope and purpose of the initiative. educate involved parties; advocate the HRDC/federal position; identify problem areas requiring special study or the strategically planned intervention of senior and Executive management of HRDC: and negotiate or develop strategies to gain a consensus on feasible and effective program policy and delivery positions.

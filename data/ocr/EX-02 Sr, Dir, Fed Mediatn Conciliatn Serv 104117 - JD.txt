The Labour Program promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, productive and cooperative work environment for all Canadians. An important component of the Program's mandate is the provision of support for effective and cooperative union- management relations. This is achieved primarily through the work of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), which provides dispute resolution and dispute prevention assistance to trade unions and employers under the jurisdiction of Part | of the Canada Labour Code (Code). The Code governs federally regulated employees in key sectors of the economy and offers employers and unionized employees tools for dispute resolution.

The FMCS also collects and disseminates information on collective bargaining settlements, work stoppages and labour organizations. An estimated 992.OOO employees are covered under Part | of the Code. Heavily unionized sectors in the federal private- sector include airlines, railways, shipping, ports, telecommunications and some federal Crown corporations such as Canada Post Corporation and Via Rail. Notable labour organizations represented within the federally-regulated private sector include UNIFOR, Teamsters Canada, the International Brotherhood of Electrical workers, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and the Canadian Union of Public Employees. The work of the Directorate is largely shaped by the environment in which it operates. The key sectors with which it deals continue to be the most dynamic sectors of our economy many of which are integral to the economic health of the country and its supply chains, thus having a significant impact on the lives of individuals and business across Canada. The FMCS is a fast-paced Directorate that regularly deals with multiple challenging issues/files simultaneously, many of which require senior level involvement and close supervision. There are a number high-profile and complex issues for which the Director General and Senior Director are required to provide leadership, including on strategies to settle high profile disputes; the provision of complex briefings and sound advice to the Offices of the Minister, the Deputy Minister and the Assistant Deputy Minister; meeting with clients; and appearing before various committees.

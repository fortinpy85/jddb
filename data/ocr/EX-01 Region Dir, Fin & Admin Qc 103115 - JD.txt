Service Canada is located in all regions of the Country through which the programs and services of HRSDC, as well as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone or through the Internet. HRSDC operates in a complex governance and accountability structure as it supports two Ministers and a Minister of State (Seniors), two Parliamentary Secretaries: a Deputy Minister, a Senior Associate Deputy Minister and Chief Operating Officer, a Deputy Minister of Labour and an Associate Deputy Minister and has complex interfaces for service delivery to Canadians and shared corporate services through the Service Canada Initiative. The operating environment is made more complex by the primary jurisdiction of provincial/territorial governments for the delivery of early childhood development. elementary, secondary, and post-secondary programs, in addition to areas of shared jurisdiction. In addition to the major changes occurring in the Department, the Government of Canada is also undergoing rapid and significant changes in the ways in which it goes about its business. The public service continues its rapid evolution to meet the political and social objectives of the government's agenda as for delivering Results for Canadians and meet the strategic and operational objectives of the government's initiatives for enhanced management practices articulated in the Modern Comptrollership principles and practices and the Modernization of the Public Service. The government of Canada has strengthened its priority for enhanced financia! control. As a result of the Federal Accountability Act, which designates deputy heads as accounting officers for their department, there is an increased importance on having strong ; financial management policies, processes and systems in place to support deputies in this role. As well the Management, Resources and Results Structure (MRRS) Policy, which took affect in 2OO5, supports the development of a common, government-wide approach to the collection, management. and reporting of financial and non-financial performance information. In providing a standard basis for reporting to citizens and Parliament on the alignment of resources, program activities and results. the policy reinforces the government's commitment to strengthen public sector management and accountability, consistent with the Management Accountability Framework (MAF). The MAF, originally created in 2OO3, is an important component of TBS/OCHRO central agency responsibility for management oversight, and establishes the framework of accountability for deputy heads to ensure that the conditions for good management are put in place in order to achieve Results for Canadians. It has evolved over time, to the point where department's conduct annual assessments against MAF measures and 3 .

The Program Activity Architecture, established to achieve these objectives, requires fundamental changes to the structure of human resources and financial systems, to track expenditures by activity and in much more detail than before.

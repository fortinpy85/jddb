The federal policy research landscape is subject to rapid change. Sources of policy research have diversified and technology continues to have a great impact on how knowledge is generated and exchanged. Policy Horizons Canada plays a significant role in connecting efforts across departments and with the non-governmental research community by catalyzing and convening opportunities for knowledge sharing, and creating capacity both to communicate policy-makers needs to the broader research community and to enable policy-makers to apply resulting analysis to policy development. Policy Horizons Canada is also at the forefront in the use of technology to create communities of researchers and in pioneering the use of new techniques as a way of enhancing policy capacity within the federal family, with partners and with emerging voices outside government. It is within this context that the Director General Policy Horizons Canada provides the vision and leadership for the creation of an agile, technically savvy and innovative organization that takes input from multiple sources, conducts flexible analysis, and provides high-value input to emerging issues. To achieve this major challenge, the Director General leads collaboration with departments to build on the existing scanning and analytical capacity across government. Using a broad interdepartmental network and maintaining links with external organizations undertaking scanning or knowledge generation, the DG provides strategic direction to the management team to produce an integrated analysis of the results of composite scanning and foresight activities. Known as MetaScan, this is a major annual undertaking with multiple components. The end-product provides Deputy Ministers and the federal policy community with ahead-of-the-curve insights on emerging issues that have the potential to significantly change the government s policy agenda over the medium to longer term. It also identifies knowledge gaps around these issues. The Director General helps present the MetaScan to the DMSC on an annual basis, to support the assessment of priority issues and the identification of future knowledge and data needs. The Director General conceives and directs innovative foresight activities and the provision of capacity support to departments that do not currently have scanning capacity through targeted training or process advice and facilitation. This fosters an interactive, integrated dialogue around emerging policy issues and challenges across Director General. Policy Horizons Canada May 2OI4 page 3

The combined HRSDC and Labour Canada workforce is thirty-five hundred and Service Canada has an additional twenty-seven thousand employees. Service Canada is located in all regions of the Country through which some of the programs and services of HRSDC, as well as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone or through the Internet.

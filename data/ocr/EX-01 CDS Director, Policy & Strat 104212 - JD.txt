NO.: TBD LEVEL: EX-OI(P) EFFECTIVE DATE: December I, 2O2I (P) GENERAL ACCOUNTABILITY The Director, Policy and Strategy (D/P), acts as a strong policy/practice influence, personally, and through an expert team, within TBS, engaging other functional areas such as the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Office of the Comptroller General (OCG), the Expenditure Management System (EMS) and program sectors, client departments, and in the context of federal/ provincial/ territorial (FPT) relations to support CDS's contribution to crafting the Government of Canada s digital transformation (DT) agenda and provides expert advice on how to substantially increase the Government of Canada s (GC) capacity to deliver modern digital services to Canadian citizens and businesses. Further, the Director is accountable for the ongoing development and provision of the full range of internal policy and strategic planning services to CDS, including corporate planning and reporting (TBS and Parliament), performance measurement, program resource management and oversight, acting as the contract authority for CDS and providing a robust management challenge and oversight as a strategic planning tool for CDS to ensure limited human and financial resources are effectively deployed to meet both current and future CDS mandate challenges in focusing on and contributing to visible improvements to GC service delivery. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE The Director, Policy and Strategy is one of four positions reporting to the Chief Operating Officer, Canadian Digital Service. The others are: Director of Talent (this is a projected role currently Head of Talent), Head of Internal Site Reliability Engineering, and Head of Internal Operations. Reporting to the Director are two managers: the Head of Strategic Policy and the Head of Delivery Policy. These managers lead two teams of expert policy advisors in support of the Director s full range of accountabilities in contributing to the DT agenda, delivering an effective policy posture, and offering embedded support to digital delivery teams, and ensuring its strategic functions meet CDS's current and future needs. NATURE AND SCOPE The Canadian Digital Service has been created to support the Government of Canada (GC) in its commitment to provide the highest quality services, to meet the expectations of millions of Canadian citizens and thousands of Canadian businesses in the digital age. CDS is housed within the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), to benefit from line of sight across government and close proximity to facilitate shaping the government-wide policies and standards that drive and scale this transformation. CDS s primary mandate is to focus first and foremost on delivery: helping September 2I, 2O2I
Director, Policy and Strategy 2 departments and agencies improve how they design and deliver services to Canadians. It does so by providing hands-on help, government-wide common platforms and components, and expertise grounded in delivery experience, and fulfills its mandate through three roles: Hands-on delivery help CDS partners with Federal departments to help them design, prototype, and build better digital services, focusing on solving problems using design, agile methods, and proven technologies that put the user at the centre of our work. CDS also develops and maintains government-wide platforms and components that address common interaction points of service delivery, with an aim to take successful, well-tested digital solutions and replicate them across government. Build capacity CDS invests in recruitment, participates in communities of practice and coaches departmental partners on the adoption of modern methods and technologies, to help public servants amplify their skills in areas like design research, design, and engineering. Provide advice Through its partnerships, CDS provides advice to the CPA grounded in practical delivery experience and global best practices. lt is within this context that the Director. Policy and Strategy, discharges the following accountabilities: Strategic Influencer Digital Transformation is a complex space with many competing priorities and players. Many hands, representing multiple policy and program views and differing priorities, are required to work together in crafting an integrated DT strategic agenda for the GC. The Director is charged with navigating that space and ensuring that CDS s mandate continues to occupy a place of influence in the crafting of the DT agenda and that the CDS mission is clearly understood and supported at the highest levels across the GC and in provinces and territories. The Director is expected to find, recommend and develop opportunities and to advise at the most senior levels of the GC and the political level on the opportunities and the strategies required for the GC to profit from them through CDS s work. For CDS to make good strategic decisions about the best use of its limited resources and where it will play in the DT space, it must, as an entire organisation, have comprehensive awareness and understanding of the full context of DT. The Director is charged with offering strategic advice to the CDS COO and CEO, to TBS senior officials, and to the Minister of Digital Government and their office. Through a full range of relationships (e.g., PCO, Department of Finance, departments, Provincial and territorial governments, international bodies, academia and research), the Director builds a full picture of the context, its complexities and challenges and where it best offers CDS opportunities to implement DT and exercise its mandate. From this work, the Director develops strategic options for and the provision of expert advice up to and including the Secretary, TB President and the Minister of Digital Government. As a key influencer, the Director also acts as a strong policy and practice influencer, both within TBS, working with other functional areas, such as the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Office of the Comptroller General (OCG),the Expenditure Management System (EMS) and program sectors, , and with client departments, and through FTP relations, in the context of CDS s aim to substantially increase the CPA's capacity to deliver modern digital services to Canadian citizens and businesses. To accomplish the above, the Director leads two teams of GC policy and digital practice experts that are supported by two managers. Members of the delivery policy team are embedded with and support CDS's Digital Delivery Teams in their client interactions. Broadly speaking, they analyse September 2I, 2O2I
Director, Policy and Strategy 3 current policies and practices, (e.g., CPA-wide functional policies and practices and internal departmental programmatic policies or legislation) that block or hamper the delivery of digital solutions, and in turn their socioeconomic and other impacts on the lives of Canadians, and influence partners to remove, modify or re-interpret them, or propose new policies/practices that align with, advance and deliver modern digital services. The team members provide feedback to the Director on both proposed solutions and the identification of issues that cannot be resolved, or have larger implications and participate in the development of new or amended government-wide policies and practice to resolve these challenges. The Director ensures that the COO and CDS as a whole are informed of the delivery experience with departmental and other partners to also inform policy- and standard-setting by TBS policy centres and to support the challenge functions carried out across the Secretariat, including the program sectors as the TBS single window. The Director works closely with TBS-wide colleagues and departments to shape recommendations for policy and practice change. Further, as the policy and practice expert, the Director leads or participates in CPA-wide projects aimed at changing government-wide practice. These can include the development of related guidelines, procedures, work tools and systems to support the implementation of new policy/practice, to improve existing delivery across the enterprise. In advancing this agenda, the Director must fully understand individual (local) policies and practices and those broader CPA-wide functional policies, their inter-relationships, and the associated central agency direction for their application. As information flows up to the Director, from delivery experiences, the incumbent also identifies opportunities for the scaling of local policy/ practice solutions to CPA-wide ones and, conversely, examines CPA wide policies for their local impact, and prepares subsequent recommendations to the COO/CEO on same, for their review and further action up to and including advising the Treasury Board President and Minister of Digital Government, in which case the Director is called upon as an expert advisor to brief the President and/or Minister of Digital Government on key issues. A critical component of this role is to ensure that government policies, regulations, and legislation are informed by delivery experience, to create a tight feedback loop between government policy and its implementation. Embedded policies or practices that currently drive the way GC service is delivered but block DT must be brought forward for review and action as necessary. Further, the Director must play a significant role in examining current (e.g.: the Privacy Act and the Canadian Human Rights Act) and proposed legislation, to ensure that digital service delivery changes conform to them or that they allow/improve digital delivery, and is expected to work closely with bodies such as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner or provincial and territorial counterparts to achieve this goal. The Director is also expected to provide advice and recommendations at the highest levels when identifying where changes to Acts and/or regulations might serve improved service delivery and DT as a whole. Although a strong change agent and challenger of norms, the Director has no direct authority to mandate change, reflecting CDS s role as a whole. This means that the Director must be a very adept influencer, balancing the need for change with the client's capacity for that change. The Director, in line with the CDS modus operandi, needs to build on those successes as examples to others who will then willingly come on board. Research Leader The Director is fully accountable for socio-economic research and the recommendations that emanate from it. By way of understanding this role, Canada is a very large, geographically dispersed country with a diverse population in large cities, small towns, villages, and farms, and includes an important aboriginal peoples contribution to its culture. Determining how to improve September 2I, 2O2I
Director, Policy and Strategy 4 the future of GC service delivery through digital change and, ultimately DT and, hence, the best direction and most important priorities for the GC digital agenda, requires fact based evidence based on socio-economic research, research on past or current issues, and the gathering of public opinion to determine where there are service gaps, where groups are underserved or receiving services in a way that does not meet their needs (e.g.: Persons with Disabilities, Indigenous Peoples). The Director synthesizes this evidence and makes recommendations on future policy change and policy setting to alleviate these issues, including, the key priorities for service change. The work also requires exceptional leadership skills and creativity to manage horizontal policy issues across CDS, TBS, departments and provinces and territories. The work is performed under broad direction and requires the provision of expert and strategic advice and guidance to CDS colleagues, the COO, the CEO and other senior executives of the Secretariat, especially those with functional policy authority, as well as contributing to, and representing the GC with international events and bodies such as the OECD and the United Nations e-government initiatives. Risk Assessor In collaboration with the other CDS areas, the Director is accountable for the identification and management of risks that could affect the CDS mission. Although risks can engender difficulties, they can also be seen as opportunities for modernization and process reengineering of policy development activities. The Director must identify such risks through broad ranging environmental scans, research and analysis, and, hence, will develop appropriate strategies to minimize risks in the development and implementation of policy and practice change recommendations that will also maximize returns in relation to the investment of limited resources to meet CDS objectives. The Director must be prepared to lead or participate in specific projects and initiatives that have a significant capacity to advance the CDS mission nationally. The Director must have a thorough understanding of the CDS and TBS mission and an understanding of the mandates, structures and level of digital sophistication and readiness in departments and agencies, in provinces and territories, and in end users, the priorities and objectives as well as the status of policies under review or development, in order to provide a meaningful contribution to executive decision-making and planning on policy development and implementation, as well as to the management of related strategic issues on behalf of CDS. Strategic Leadership The Director's policy role, which is a part of CDS service delivery, places the incumbent in the unique role of bringing a full understanding of CDS s context and challenges to the internal planning, reporting, strategic functioning of and resource management within CDS. The Director is accountable for preparing CDS's input to the TBS strategic business planning framework and provides expert input into all corporate planning initiatives/documents (e.g. DR, DP), managing the implementation of planning processes and providing input to the development of strategic and operational plans to facilitate approval and meet strategic objectives. The incumbent directs the implementation of CDS's input to the TBS performance reporting/program evaluation policies and processes in accordance with the TBS' approved evaluation standards and participating in, or leading evaluation projects. The incumbent defines and recommends options with respect to the required strategic planning direction and the identification of the major objectives to be achieved by CDS as part of its mandate and its leadership role with respect to improved service delivery. The Director develops and/or horizontally integrates CDS's strategic planning and related legislative, policy, program and other proposals for submission to the CEO and COO for review and decision making; and provides strategic advice and briefings to all CDS senior management on complex and sensitive issues.

The Director plays an important role in the CDS budgeting process, not simply from a planning and accounting perspective, but from an in-depth understanding of CDS s strategic priorities and its context, to ensure resource proposals and decisions are aligned with them. Further, the incumbent analyses planning submissions and performance reports, synthesizing and consolidating information gathered and providing input to key corporate reports and providing strategic advice, in concert with others, on planning and analysis issues, to the COO and senior management for approval and submission to TBS.

Given the incumbent's broad perspective, the Director consults with and provides advice and guidance to senior CDS management regarding the integration of HR and financial planning into CDS's strategic business plan and drawing the linkage between all of CDS s organizational areas specific issues to create an overall CDS strategic planning document. Further, the incumbent conducts performance measurement exercises and longer-term monitoring and issues analyses; and identifies and analyses evolving accountability issues implications: The incumbent identifies CDS issues, problem areas, policies or programs that require review and/or enhancements, or are under review by TBS Internal Audit, recommending and supporting the conduct of evaluation reviews; identifying gaps; and preparing and providing recommendations to the COO and senior CDS management. In support of the above, the Director provides in-depth analyses and develops recommended responses, solutions to emerging issues through developing and sustaining effective internal and external networks and strong collaborative ties with other CDS areas and Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) policy and program centres to avoid, and ultimately eliminate, the dissemination of duplicate or contradictory positions, direction or guidance. As the CDS Technical Authority (TA) for substantial and high impact portions of CDS contracting, the incumbent oversees the full contracting process, including developing new contracting vehicles for the GC aimed, for example, at engaging small and medium contractors to carry out task-based delivery contracts on behalf of CDS in line with its incremental strategy. In concert with TBS contracting authorities and PSPC, the incumbent oversees the evaluation of bids and makes recommendations and, accordingly, signs off on behalf of CDS. Accritical element of the Director s role as TA is to identify and apply lessons learned from contracts to ensure the continuous improvement of the process and the outcomes. Managerial Leadership The D/PS leads and grows the P&S team and is expected to create a positive, flexible, innovative and supportive work culture reflective of their mandate and the mission of CDS as a whole.

Director, Policy and Strategy 6 be timely, accurate and able to respond to rapid shifts in the work while respecting human and financial limitations. Critical Risks/Challenges The Director, Policy and Strategy faces the following key critical risks and challenges: e Given the significant amount of influencing required to successfully advocate for changes to GC-wide rules and processes as well as the relationship between government policy- making and digital delivery, there is a risk that the Director, Policy and Strategy may face challenges in momentum as a result of institutional and individual norms, risk tolerances, and willingness to adapt or change by both senior leaders and; e In light of CDS s relatively small organizational size, combined with its relative maturity (<5 years) as a central digital organization within the Government of Canada, the Director, Policy and Strategy may face challenges in advocating for changes in CDS s programmatic mandate, authorities and funding, particularly in relation to service delivery departments and other central agency and digital organizations.

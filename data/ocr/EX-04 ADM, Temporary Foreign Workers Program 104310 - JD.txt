NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Lead by five Ministers and six Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. In 2O2I-22, ESDC expenditures on programs and services totalled $I78.3B. Of this amount, more than 95% directly benefitted Canadians through El, CPP, OAS and other statutory transfer payments. Service Canada forms the program delivery arm of ESDC, managing over 37 programs with 66 streams and over 52 thousand grants and contributions (Gs&Cs) agreements as one of the largest and most diverse Gs&Cs portfolios across the Government of Canada (GoC). Service Canada provides Canadians with a single point of access to ESDC programs and helps Canadians access other GoC programs and services. The Temporary Foreign Worker Program facilitates access to an important labour pool for Canadian businesses when qualified Canadians are not available. ESDC/Service Canada s TFW Program allows Canadian employers to hire foreign workers to fill temporary jobs. The Program is regulated through the /mmigration and Refugee Protection Act and the immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations and is administered in partnership with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The TFW Program Branch is mandated to respond to evolving labour market conditions by addressing employers labour market needs, and ensuring foreign workers are protected, while fostering a public service that supports the Program's vision. The ADM, TFW Program Branch, provides leadership and vision in using an agile methodology and model that brings together 3
Policy, Operations, and Compliance directorates within one Branch. This results in a more streamlined governance, simplified operations, and clearer accountability among a host of partners and stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions. The ADM provides well-informed and integrated advice, briefings, and recommendations that have been analyzed through TFW Program and whole of government lenses to the Minister(s), DM, COO, and senior officials across ESDC and Service Canada. This broad, all-encompassing perspective gives the Minister, DM and COO the necessary information in an operating environment that contains interdependencies and interconnections across several jurisdictions and among diverse stakeholders. The ADM performs a key briefing role that is both sensitive and challenging, especially when advice and recommendations are required on short notice, and solutions will be played out in both domestic and international arenas. The ADM s advisory role is particularly important in that the Ministers, DMs and COO rely on the ADM to provide sound and strategic advice that they can act upon with trust and confidence on a complicated and high-profile domestic and international political stage. This role also highlights the added complexity of reporting to the DM, ESDC on policy-related issues and the Service Canada COO on program delivery matters in an integrated and coherent manner. As well, the ADM attends and presents to Parliamentary sessions and must be prepared to credibly field pressing questions in a bi-partisan venue. The TFW Program Policy to Service Continuum framework involves developing or modifying all program policies, with changes driven by regulatory or legislative amendments, Ministerial instruction, new and amended program policy measures, and external stakeholder engagement and input. The strength of the model lies in its integrated and inclusive approach, such that, at the development stage, policy options are informed by the Operations and Compliance lenses to take into consideration the feasibility of policy approaches and impacts on operations and service delivery. This approach allows adjustments to be made early in the process. Working groups are formed to ensure input from across the Branch at all phases of the continuum. The risk in the agile model is that the large number of stakeholders and variables could cause overwhelm development and implementation, thereby slowing progress. At the initiation and planning phases, the ADM identifies and raises issues for discussion and decision by the governance committees to ensure a common understanding and full support. The ADM is responsible for providing a clear vision for the Branch & regions that enables the delineation of the issues, articulation of policy intent, timely operationalization, and improved service delivery. In advancing the agenda, the incumbent must also take into consideration the political perspective, economic conditions, and the views and positions of external stakeholders, as well as decisions taken by governance committees. The ADM is also accountable for the integrity of policy and program development processes across the continuum. This means the same rigour must be applied in the agile model as in traditional development efforts. For example, when the Policy directorate is drafting program policy guidance documents, Operations is reviewing and updating web contents related to the policy change. At the implementation stages, Compliance and/or Operations works with the Service Canada regions to implement new operational guidance for the policy change. The ADM must ensure that progress in all areas advances seamlessly, underpinned by risk management and performance management frameworks so that there is coherence among many moving parts. This double-loop approach provides lessons learned and best practices going forward. 4
The ADM oversees the development and testing of various innovations to streamline processes, better respond to labour market conditions, and reduce the administrative burden for employers proven to be compliant. In leading such innovative approaches, the ADM must take into consideration and address & mitigate concerns about displacing domestic workers/displaced domestic workers. The ADM establishes and manages numerous and diverse relationships, across the Department with involved Branches, and among OGDs, provinces, territories, private sector parties and international entities. The provinces and territories put forward varying requirements regarding the employment contracts, whereas Quebec requires a Qu bec Acceptance Certificate as well as the federal permit and the ADM engages in discussions and negotiations with Quebec on behalf of the federal government. The ADM engages internal and external governance committees on policy and program issues and needed changes. Committees include the National ADM Governance Committee, Directors General Interdepartmental Committee, the Canada-Mexico Contact Group, and other international stakeholders. The ADM represents Canada at quarterly meetings with Mexican and Caribbean officials regarding Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) Employment Contracts that set out the overall conditions and requirements for the SAWP program and is accountable for the outcomes of all negotiations involving the TFW Program. The challenge in managing numerous and varied relationships is that the ADM must be familiar with the agendas and objectives of each stakeholder, including those of foreign governments. As well, the ADM must appreciate how the Policy to Service continuum will affect all stakeholders, including Service Canada s Regional service points. The ADM frequently consults with the Minister and Minister's Office to gain insight on other key considerations, some involving partner departments Ministers and their offices. The ADM is accountable for ensuring that a communications plan with clear method of communication is established and sustained by respective working groups with input from across the Branch. In terms of external communications, the Operations Directorate manages the creation and maintenance of the TFW Program website with content from each Directorate. The TFW Program's Policy to Service Continuum makes significant knowledge demands of the ADM, especially since the model is successful only if the three streams, specifically policy, operations and compliance are planned, developed and implemented concurrently as directed by the ADM. The ADM s technical know-how is challenged by the large volume and complexity of high-profile issues, each one requiring consultation based on a thorough understanding of intra/interdepartmental governance and interjurisdictional arrangements and associated touch points. The ADM must also navigate the Ministers Offices and any Parliamentary requirements to ensure that the Program is represented credibly. The ADM is a member of the Departmental Portfolio Management Board, which sets the Department's strategic direction, and various departmental sub-committees, which reviews and adjusts program operations and corporate requirements. The incumbent contributes to the formulation of departmental policies, priorities, and practices, especially where they interface with the TFW Program. DIMENSIONS Budget FY2O24-25 5

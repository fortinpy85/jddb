NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS Information Required The Program The Canadian passport is an internationally recognized Canadian identity document and its security and integrity requires diligence in administering the passport program. It has a high domestic profile and the program is publically and politically sensitive to delays, misuse and fraud. There is no Canadian passport statute. Passports are issued under the Royal Prerogative and exercised by the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and governed by an Order-in-Council. The Passport Order states that the Minister may authorize the Minister of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC} to exercise some functions including the collection of applications and supporting documents, verification of information, collecting and cancelling valid or expired passports, collecting fees, processing applications, producing passports, and delivering passports to applicants. Through ESDC's Service Canada Initiative, access to passport services is available in-person at 34 passport offices and over 3OO Service Canada receiving agent locations. Applications can also be mailed for processing at one of the passport processing centres in Canada. Service Canada is responsible for service delivery in accordance with the established service standards. Processing timeframes for passports are between IO 2O days, not including mailing time, depending on the avenue of service chosen. Additionally, urgent passport applications can be processed in as little as one day. Although the passport program is delivered by a government organization, it is run more like a private- sector company. It operates on a cost-recovery basis, which means that tax dollars are not used to fund the program. The fees paid by applicants cover the passport itself, as well as staff, security and identity authentication, and the infrastructure needed for producing and issuing passports. The passport program's cost-recovery funding model finances a high-quality service in addition to producing and distributing passports. The Position_ The primary responsibility of the Director, Passport Processing, is to provide leadership for the management and delivery of all aspects of the processing centre and for the quality of service delivered to the public. The Director is accountable for developing the business and operational plans and the associated resource requirements needed to meet fluctuations in workload. A principal challenge is the management of fluctuating service demands and therefore resources in an environment that depends entirely upon a revolving fund sustained by fees for passport services. Success as an organization depends heavily on the managerial effectiveness of the Director. Revenue dependency presents the Director with challenges such as the requirement to operate on the basis of private sector business principles; to instill a client-responsiveness and customer-driven philosophy; to introduce the systems and processes required to rigorously manage the operation: and to make informed and timely operational, financial and human resources decisions in response to changing business conditions. The Director must take into account forecasted volumes, seasonal fluctuations, and historical demand patterns and translate this information into resource requirements. The Director exercises the authority granted in the Instrument of Delegation of Human Resources Authorities. They are responsible for developing and implementing human resource management plans for the Directorate in compliance with human resources policies, the values of the organization and for directing the conduct of staffing, classification, employee relations and human resources planning activities. The Director oversees corporate responsibilities and roles including meeting legal and regulatory obligations relating to the workplace such as Emergency Continuity Planning and Official Languages as they apply to corporate responsibilities. The incumbent provides leadership and co-ordination of Health and Safety Committees and Labour Management Committees ensuring engagement and input to address Page 2 of 5
specific concerns. The Director is responsible for ensuring the security of both employees and passport documents. The security of employees involves the protection of individuals working in the processing centre by ensuring premises are secure and meet established guidelines. The Director is also responsible to ensure all employees have security clearance. The security of passport documents is necessary to maintain the integrity of an internationally recognized document and involves developing and maintaining employee awareness of security requirements to detect and eliminate fraud. The Director is responsible in collaboration with Area Directors and the Director General for the creation, coordination, and implementation of comprehensive operational, financial, and risk management frameworks. This includes the development of annual business plans for the directorate within the context of national and regional priorities, and the evaluation and reporting of results against the plans. The Director requires thorough knowledge and understanding of the goals and mandate of Service Canada Initiative, IRCC s passport program, the broader skill development objectives of the Government, and public service management principles and techniques. The Director is required to apply sophisticated management of change skills in leading management team members to embrace new ways of conducting business, and to seek out and adopt technological innovations. Inter-relationships Working with the Director General, the Business Expertise Executive Director and Strategic Services, the Director is tasked to establish and direct the implementation of a performance measurement framework that details standards of delivery of service and how the process will function with the key tasks of monitoring, evaluation and reporting processes. The Director must have knowledge of the Service Canada Initiative and regional issues as a member of various national and regional committees. The Area Director manages the financial and human resources allocated to the Directorate and ensure management activities are aligned and consistent with the operational management framework as articulated by the Director General, Citizen Service and by working with the Chief Financial Officer Branch and Human Resources. The Director monitors adherence to approved business and functional plans and effects adjustments to plans throughout the fiscal year in response to changing circumstances, emerging priorities and evolving corporate strategic objectives. The Director leads the development and preparation of executive correspondence and material for the offices of the Minister, Deputy Minister, Chief Operating Officer and regional Assistant Deputy Minister, and other senior ESDC / SC executives. Correspondence and material deals, primarily, with service delivery channels and related matters that have implications for the access of Canadians to the program and service offerings of the Government.

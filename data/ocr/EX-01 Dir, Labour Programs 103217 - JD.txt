NATURE AND SCOPE: When the Department of Human Resources Development Canada was formed in I993, the former Department of Labour was one of the major components of the new Department. HRSDC focuses on the management of the labour market, employment and employability, learning and literacy, income security, economic well being, social policy and development and other human resources development issues, including Labour. Due to the recognized importance of the Labour program and its differing client, stakeholder and partner base, this component of the new Department was assigned a Minister to oversee the federal Labour portfolio. While the Labour program works within the HRSDC context, its policy and operational focuses and associated initiatives and activities operate in a largely separate and distinct fashion from those of the main priorities and programs of HRSDC. Its work force also has very differing legislation and knowledge and skills set requirements. The national Labour Program also receives very strong functional direction and guidance from the ADM, Labour in Headquarters due to the unique nature of the program and the very specialized legislative, policy, planning and programs delivery frameworks and processes. The HRSDC Labour program administers Parts I, HI and III of the Canada Labour Code (CLC). Part I involves the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes and the resolution of labour/management conflict in the Federal Private Sector. While Headquarters basically delivers these services, the Regions provide significant local level information and input to the involved HQs staff. The administration of Part II of the CLC involves the provision of occupational safety and health services for federal jurisdiction industries and federal employees covered by the Public Service Staff Relations Act for collective bargaining. Part III] covers the labour standards, occupational health and safety and industrial relations for private sector industries under federal jurisdiction. Federal jurisdiction includes rail and air transportation, inter-provincial trucking, great lakes and international shipping, ports, longshoring, grain handling, inter-provincial and international communication, banking and nuclear fuel industries. The work environment has become increasingly complex and sensitive over the past several years. Recent years have seen a globalization of business and cost pressures throughout Western economies, giving rise to a rapid reduction in labour gains achieved through the bargaining process, the polarization of hours of work, and little or no increase in real wages in most sectors of the Canadian economy. Businesses are now highly sensitive to wage and benefit pressures, are intent on streamlining operations and see regulatory compliance as a cost item. Unions have seen their influence diminish, are struggling to redefine themselves around the new economy, and are launching new membership drives in service industries. A rapidly expanding segment of the population is now active in home business enterprises or is engaged in part-time work or job-sharing and is increasingly sensitive to benefits issues. In the dynamic of this labour market of the new millennium, the HRSDC Labour Program must guide the implementation of a comprehensive workplace strategy that encompasses federal policy and program objectives, and utilizes the legislative and administrative tools of the Department to modernize the Canada Labour Code and work place and environment in a manner that balances economic, market-driven objectives with social goals and contributes to the broader priorities of the Ministers of Labour and HRSDC. Under this framework for the modemization of the federal Labour portfolio and activitics, major preoccupations and objectives include the need to: improve protection for workers; promote productivity through innovative workplace practices; promote more flexible working time arrangements; create harmonious workplaces through good industrial relations; support working environments that are safe and healthy; achieve diverse workplaces that O/T IO8 2
Human Resources Development Canada Director, Labour Program are) and equitable; and assist workers to increase skills and adopt life-long learning As well, Occupational Safety and Health has assumed a much higher profile recently due to such factors as increased attention to accident prevention, joint safety responsibilities, the short and long-term effects on health of hazardous substances including chemicals, dust and asbestos, the psychological effects of new technologies, and court rulings on cases involving an employer s liability when unsafe working conditions are not addressed. Employment conditions and employee relations have also assumed new importance as a result of increased understanding by employees of their rights and entitlements, and the corresponding responsibility of employers to ensure fair and equitable treatment. As a consequence, standards legislation has become much broader in scope dealing with matters such as unjust dismissal and harassment, in addition to the traditional hours of work and wage concepts. These changes have resulted in the requirement for new techniques when dealing with issues in which the emphasis has tended to swing away from relying only upon regulation and control in a policing sense, to one which includes persuasion and cooperation to voluntarily meet the legislated requirements. These changes have also contributed to the adoption of new non-legislated programs based on education and cooperation as exemplified by the Labour -Management Partnership Program. As well as the above factors and dynamics, the Region s Labour Program must also address the recommendations stemming from the Region s comprehensive Organization Review exercise. This Review examined all aspects of the Region, including its organization and resource base and its Report made key recommendations for the Region s diverse and decentralized Labour programs. Major issues were: 2 centralize all Labour functions by having them report to one Regional Director, Labour Program; and ) enhance the representational profile for the position by making it the Region s member on HRSDC s Directorate Executive Committee (DEC). The Region s Labour Program is wide spread and covers over 6,OOO work sites in the Region, ranging from a northern ocean port on the Arctic Ocean to one-industry mining communities, rural farms, fishing resorts, remote Native reserves and larger urban centres. The work forces at these sites are represented by several different and major employee groups such as: the Teamsters Union; Canadian Union of Postal Workers; Public Service Alliance of Canada; International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; Communications and Electrical Workers of Canada; Canadian Brotherhood of Railway, Transport and General Workers; Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Workers and the Letter Carriers Union of Canada. The move to foster Aboriginal self- government and more devolution of authority to Aboriginal organizations including the responsibility for economic development in their communities is also leading to greater focus on workplace conditions and labour relations as they rely on advisory services from the Region. There are also ongoing federal-provincial relations and agreements and interfaces regarding the delivery of the Labour Program services with the four jurisdictions involved (e.g., Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Northwestern Ontario and Nunavut). The geographic scope of the position is extremely large and requires the direction and management of the Labour Program for Manitoba as well as service delivery arrangements as follows: (i)Alberta Region receives Labour Services for the DEW Line and Eastern Arctic except, Baffin Island, and the Nunavut Territory is provided with services in Fire Protection Engincering; Labour Standards and Fair Wages; Occupational Safety and Health; Employment Equity and the administration of the Federal Contactors Program; and, Technical Advisory expertise. (ii) the Saskatchewan Region receives Technical Services for Part IJ and II] of the Labour Code; Fire Protection Engineering; and, Injury Compensation administration and services (iii) Northwestern Ontario receives Fire Protection Engineering services from Manitoba Region. It is in this challenging operational context that the Regional Director, Labour Program must reorient the policy and service delivery frameworks for the Region s Labour Program. The position has a leadership role to merge the OI/I I/O8 3
Human Resources Development Canada Director, Labour Program tory decentralized Labour Operations components into the Regional Headquarters Labour Program in order to provide coherent and knowledgeable line management for the total regional Labour function. As well, the Director must develop priorities and objectives that emphasize the need to promote a fair, safe, healthy, stable and cooperative work environment for all workers and to create stronger ties with the four provincial and territorial governments, business leaders, aboriginal associations and labour unions on operational issues, such as safety and health, employment equity, and best practices. While actively pursuing legislative change, where warranted, the position must also innovate within the existing Labour Program legislative/regulatory frameworks through novel consultative processes and the sharing of information, facilitating dialogue and developing increased awareness of employers, unions and employees of the needs and benefits of adaptation to new technology. The scope of the position extends from day-to-day assignment of responsibilities to the establishment of priorities and the development of policy. The Regional Director plans, organizes, coordinates, establishes priorities and develops and defines policies within which present programs will be delivered, and future strategic orientations and business priorities and plans developed. The Regional Director is vested, either by Order-in-Council ,or through identification in regulations pursuant to Parts II and III of the Canada Labour Code and the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act, with the authority to judge, permit or direct compliance with Code and/or regulations. This includes the problems of determining acceptable safety and health precautions, the circumstances in which prosecutions should be undertaken, and whether or not a complete shutdown of an establishment should be ordered. The Regional Director must have the ability, experience and resources to direct Labour programs of diverse kinds and characteristics. In the process of coordinating the various aspects of programs, the Regional Director must consider outside factors such as Provincial and Industrial policies, economic concerns changing institutional features of Canada s industrial relations system, public awareness and demands, etc. These factors are having a considerable impact on the analytical and empirical methodologies implemented to define the appropriate response to the complicated and urgent requests for assistance from the Program. The Regional Director is responsible for directing the provision of services and support to enable the Department to meet its mission objectives as they relate to occupational health and safety, labour standards, income maintenance for the injured, labour management relations and fire prevention within the assigned geographic zone. He/she is expected to provide advice and direction on all aspects of policy and programs under his/her jurisdiction in a continually changing environment which requires re-design and reinforcement of programs with consistent monitoring of their impact on regional and departmental goals. The Regional Director must ensure a cohesive approach to the internal management of the Program across the Region; approved HRSDC and Regional goals, strategic priorities, business plans and resource ceilings must be translated into the Program s operating circumstances and resource direction and allocation. This requires the incumbent to maintain a broad knowledge of government activities, provincial or territorial as well as federal, and Cabinet priorities to provide an acceptable level of service while remaining flexible enough to respond quickly to unforeseen developments within a context of limited resources. The Regional Director oversees the formulation, interpretation and maintenance of the Regional Labour Program s policies, procedures and working relationships with senior executives of provincial and/or territorial governments, private industry, Crown corporations, unions/labour, aboriginal organizations and other associations. This is essential to ensure harmonized approaches and strategies and the development of an overall operational context that fosters smooth and consistent Labour Program administration. The effectiveness and efficiency of this program management requirement is highly dependent on the incumbent s ability to demonstrate a depth of program knowledge and significant problem solving skills. The complexity of programs and problems requires extensive knowledge of the subject matter as well as adaptive thinking in broadly defined areas. OI/II/O8 4
ry Human Resources Development Canada Director, Labour Program TG sonal Director is expected to be an active member of various HRSDC national and/or regional committees which meet regularly to discuss representations on policies, programs and the management of the department s national Labour Program. As mentioned previously, the incumbent will sit as the Region s member of the Directorate Executive Committee and is also a member of the Region s Senior Management Committee as well as the chair of various HRDC-provincial or federal-industry or labour committees. A major challenge to the position is to develop strategic and policy concepts and assess, recommend and articulate alternative strategies for the labour Program and Region to pursue. This requires the continuing development of new approaches and the balancing of priorities to meet the expressed needs of diversified clientele located in four provincial/territorial jurisdictions. A further challenge is in determining acceptable safety and health precautions, the circumstances in which prosecutions should be undertaken and whether or not a complete shutdown of an establishment should be ordered. Decisions such as these require the balancing of the welfare of workers with those of social and economic well-being of the community. Other challenges include the translation of legislative and policy directions into meaningful operating instructions which can readily understood by officers implementing a number of programs in the Region. The Regional Director develops strategies and exercises personal judgment as to the most appropriate time to advise or seek approval at higher level, thus playing a major role in shaping the position of the Labour Program as it relates to regional and departmental objectives. Recurring contacts are maintained with Deputy Ministers and other senior staff of provincial and/or territorial governments, senior officials of private industry, unions, aboriginal organizations, employee associations, Crown corporations and the Public Service to define and discuss legislation and regulations and their interpretation. Contacts are also conducted with many of the above officials to tesolve conflicts and discuss possible closures and other measures for non-compliance. Regular contact is maintained with the Regional Director General, Director General of Compliance and Regional Operations and the ADM, Labour and other officials of the department to present new policy proposals, changes in programs, legislation and regulations, and to discuss regional operational long term and strategic plans.

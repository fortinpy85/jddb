| oe Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada Specific functions of the positions reporting to the Executive Director, Labour Market and Social Development Programs are as follows: the Director, Labour Market Information; Directors Program Delivery (2-3); Directors of Designated LMSDP programs (2-3; and this position Director, Centre of Specialization. The Director, Centre of Specialization is responsible for staff of 55 FTEs [or above] consisting of; - the Manager of Policy, Research and Analysis [3O FTEs], responsible for studies, research and development of proposals to anticipate and meet the labour market or social conditions specific to the particular target clientele; and - the Manager of Stakeholder Relations (25 FTEs], responsible for managing all federal/provincial/territorial and stakeholder relationships for the specified program and for related coordination of consultation arrangements to gain multi-jurisdictional and client spokespersons consensus. Note- The structure and FTEs vary somewhat from region to region. Overall O&M and FTEs are presented in the Dimensions section. NATURE AND SCOPE Program Context HRSDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities as related to the development of human capital; to promote an efficient labour market in part through Federal-Provincial/Territorial labour market frameworks; leading and reinforcing the development of workplace skills, including strong linkages and partnerships with employers; enhancing access to post-secondary education and lifelong learning; delivering government services and income benefits through the Service Canada Initiative; and regulating and promoting fairness and health and safety in Canadian workplaces. The regional Labour Market and Social Development Programs business stream is responsible for developing and implementing the Human Resources Skills Development Canada/Service Canada Initiative service delivery strategy. More specifically it includes the management of the grants and contributions programs for youth, working age adults, employers, seniors, persons with disabilities, aboriginal people, and official language minority communities. This also includes such programs as Youth Programs; National Homelessness Partnering Strategy, Aboriginal Programs, Workplace Skills Strategy, New Horizons for Seniors Program, Labour Market Information, Work Sharing Program, Temporary Foreign Worker Program and other special and emerging programs such as the EcoAUTO program. [The Position The Director, Centre of Specialization provides for the identification of needs and the development and implementation of specialized programs that contribute to enhanced social and employment opportunities for specific population segments in the region; and that may be extended nationally to other regions. While the Specific Accountabilities are encapsulated in a later section of this document the challenges involved in this leadership role warrant elaboration. At a very general level and extending across all of the programs managed and delivered within this business stream, there is a special requirement for adaptation and path-finding. Each region has its own social, education and employment characteristics, opportunities and limitations. Director, Centre of Specialization Labour Market and Social Development Programs Page 2 of 6
| oe Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada These vary widely from region to region, and within regions. For example, Labour issues are widely varied from industrial manufacturing regions to commerce based regions, even more so at the present. Beyond these variations there are segments of the population for which there are special needs in terms of social and employment opportunities and programs to enhance access to those opportunities. [The requirement has been identified for a number of these Director positions that are dedicated to enhancement of social or employment opportunities for special population segments. These include a Director, Centre of Specialization respecting Foreign and Temporary Workers in western Canada and another Director relative to Day care or Live-in workers in Ontario. While the respective Branches of HRSDC or in other agencies and jurisdictions establish the policy parameters and envelopes within these programs, the detailed analytical assessments of labour market and special social needs of various segments of the labour work force and social groupings is essentially under the relatively independent purview of this Director, as well as assessment of the special social program and community development needs, education support, or programs, for example, for older workers and persons with disabilities. ] [Challenges] The complexity of this role is found in each of the analytic stages that are required; the identification of needs, determining and assessing the factors that contribute to the special requirements, researching the availability of existing programs provided federally or by other Jurisdictions that can in brought to play; developing an action plan for effective implementation of the respective servicers, and negotiating with the various sources and contributors to such a program of remediation or support. By way of example, in the specialized program for live-in or day care workers, an analysis is required of current benefits, as well as existing legislative licensing issues and potential prohibitions or limitations; existing associations and what they are attempting to achieve: potential restrictive influences by labour or professional unions; factors that prevent further skills development; and language problems, visa or citizenship issues. Once the problem areas are identified and assessed, the research for potential avenues and sources of employment or social support must be conducted. Which of these, or in what combination, can then be mobilized within a strategic action plan toward the desired outcomes? This is then followed by a network of consultations amongst these sources of support to put the overall program into effect, ensuring an optimum synergy amongst the individual vehicles. Indeed each of the forgoing stages has its own complexity. For example, if the target clientele [such as live-in workers] is not well organized, if there are no recognized spokespersons, in the initial phase of problem identification, how can one gain a direct indication of the significance of the problem or particular need? Special means may be required to obtain proxy indicators from other agencies, church groups, etc. The Director must provide leadership in assessing the various potential Social Development or Employment Projects to be funded within the Region or through shared contributions. The assessment must consider if the projects promote this greater independence on the one hand , and on the other, the development of inclusive communities through innovative tools, best practices and models of full participation and integration, including overcoming fear or stigmatization. This sort of social intervention analysis requires the most sophisticated causative factor identification, risk-assessment, and optimization principles to discern the most cost Director, Centre of Specialization Labour Market and Social Development Programs Page 3 of 6

The diversity of social programs and the instruments and program vehicles that may be applied represent an integration of major public initiatives of many earlier departments and their programs, now bundled together under the mantle of LMSDP. This vast collection of program initiatives that employs direct funding, grants, contributions and partnership arrangements to influence the labour market and to activate social support mechanisms across the region, requires an understanding and expertise in the field of social animation and intervention theory and practice, as well as the managerial and leadership capacity to integrate the work of the section specialists toward common cause and result. The further level of challenge within the foregoing is in being aware of such a flux of rapidly changing external influences within the region such as economic trends, labour market variances, unemployment variances; socio-economic trends, demographics and aging population, urbanization, immigration, education, poverty, visible minorities; along with contextual changes such as technological advancements and Government Priorities, Central Agency requirements such as the Management Accountability Framework, and the Federal Accountability Act. Interrelationships and Authority The Director works with the Executive Director of Strategic Services to build the performance measurement framework that details standards for delivery of services and how the process will function with the key tasks being monitoring, evaluation and reporting processes. The position requires knowledge and skill for policy and program development both as a source of advice on regional issues and as a member of various committees within the region and across the country. The Director must work closely with the Citizen Service, Processing and Payment Services and Integrity Services to support the Service Canada Initiative vision to meet the social needs of citizens and communities. The Director provides regional leadership for subordinate specialists in policy and program development and research as well as in the critical role in stakeholder and client consultations; in developing new and ongoing working relationships and contributions agreements, partnership arrangements, cooperation and capacity building, and coordination of programs. What is stressed is that the work of the Director, Centre of Specialization, represents both a regional as well as a national functional role in the development of the designated specialized programs. Programs, for example, developed within the Ontario Centre in respect of Live-In Workers, may be extended and adapted to other regions within the Program Delivery envelope of the LMSDP business stream.

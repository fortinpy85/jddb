Administrative Assistant, responsible for the provision of administrative services to the Director s Office. NATURE AND SCOPE The Canadian Passport Office is a decentralized organization located in the National Capital Region and at regional offices covering Ontario and eastern and western Canada. In order to provide as efficient a service as possible and as close to the domicile of Canadians, regional offices consists of a Head office and a network of local offices, which, depending on the region, may be located in different provinces and different time zones from cach other and from the main regional office. Since I99O, the Passport Office has been designated as a Special Operating Agency. This status provides the Passport Office with greater latitude in managerial and operational freedom, but also requires the Office to generate revenue sufficient to maintain all of its own operating expenses and those of the functions within Headquarters. The Passport Office is accountable for the provision of authoritative travel documents to Canadians. These documents must conform to international standards and requirements and their validity must be internationally recognized. Each of the regional offices and their local offices are responsible for providing Canadians with these documents. However, while it is the intention of the government to not unnecessarily restrict the freedom of movement of Canadians, there is no automatic right to a passport or other travel document. Rather, this is a privilege and all passports remain the property of the Crown, There is no legislative authority governing the issuance of passports. Passports remain the royal prerogative and are governing by three Orders-in-Council. This absence of legislative authority requires each of the Regional Directors to exercise a greater degree of discretion and judgment in the issuance of passports then would normally be the case. The Passport Office has established rules and criteria governing the issuance of passports and travel documents. These rules and criteria are subject to periodic review, and, as a member of the Passport Office s Executive Committee, it is the responsibility of the Regional Directors, along with the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Executive Committee to assess these and make such changes as required. The major challenge for the Director is the management of the regional passport office and its various local offices. The objective is to provide Canadian residents in the region with passport services as efficiently as possible at a reasonable cost. To determine the projected annual cost of the regional operation for each year, the Regional Director must project the demand for passports likely to arise over the next year. To some extent, this demand will be influenced by the region s economic condition, as demand will depend on the financial ability of citizens to travel. The Director must carefully assess this situation, as on the basis of historical data and by continuous scanning of local economic conditions from a variety of sources and organizations, a certain percentage of the population will renew their passports whether the intend to travel or not, while other will requires passports for business travel even during times of economic downturn, and still others may delay their travel and consequently their need for travel documents. As the region is revenue dependent, this information is vital to the Regional Director to be able 2
Regional Director, to forecast revenue and resource requirements. The price for passports services are fixed and cannot be changed without regulator review of the Passport Office fee structure. This is already a highly sensitive issues, as there is growing public and business reaction to user fees, particularly when there is no alternative. Accordingly, revenue is wholly dependent on passport applications and passports issue. As a government operation, the Regional Director must also provide a variety of services for which no fee can be charged in his or her capacity as the only domestic presence of DFAIT outside of the National Capital Region. For example, the Passport Office will provide information to applicants wishing to travel to certain countries or parts of the world with such information as Visa requirements, if any, special restrictions on the importation of personal goods which that country or countries may apply, travelers advisories respecting security or other dangers, ct any other pertinent information of assistance to travels. Given the sensitive nature of the information required for passports and the need to protect this, as well as the need to guard against fraudulent applications, theft, or misuse of passports, it is incumbent upon the Director to ensure that a variety of security procedures and a security cleared staff are available.. (Stolen passports are high value commodities on the illegal market while the information contained in passports applications would be of considerable valuc to unscrupulous individuals). This also involves security of the staff against threats or actual violence by disgruntled applicants Consequently, the challenge for the Director is to provide efficient and secure service to the public, while at the same time trying to reduce service costs without jeopardizing service coverage or security. An additional challenge for the Director is to expand the service coverage of the Passport Office to the population of the region. As it is not cost-efficient to locate Passport Offices in every community, the Director will reach agreements with other government organizations, both federal and provincial, and the private sector, to accept and forward passport applications and maintain stocks of these as well as all relevant information for the use of the local population. The Director may negotiate such agreements, which may be on the basis of pilot projects or more permanent arrangements, including costs to the Passport Office, and if satisfactory, renew these agreements from time to time. In managing the regional Passport Office, a particular challenge for the Director is to manage resources in accordance with fluctuations in workload or for other high demand situations. This requires the Director to develop and maintain a staff which is well trained and capable to perform a variety of different task and responsibilities, and is adaptable and highly motivated. The resource objective is to maintain the optimum staff level in relation to demand and cost of services and to deploy them in such a way as to maximize the operation s efficiency and service. As the offices within the region are geographically dispersed and may be located in different time zones, the overall management of the region at a distance and the best utilization of available staff resources poses a particular challenge. This is compounded in some regions by the difficulty in recruiting bilingual staff to provide services in both official languages. The Director must ensure that both language groups reccive identical levels of service, and make such peak adjustments as required to guarantee this. Particular problems may arise when applicants are refused a passport. Such situation may require the personal involvement and intervention of the Director. Legitimate refusals may arise as a result of the possibility of child abduction, suspected fraud and/or other entitlement issues where the issuance of a passport may be delayed pending further investigation, or denied. In such cases applicants will often enlist the aid of the local Member of Parliament. The Director must personally review such cases and either support and justify the withholding of a passport, or use discretion to issue the document on humanitarian, compassionate or other similar grounds. This involves an assessment of 3
Regional Director, risk based on the credibility of the applicant and the likelihood that the passport will not be misused or used for the purpose of committing an illegal act. The Director also deals with the Consular Affairs section of Canadian embassies abroad in instances in which traveling Canadians require assistance duc to the loss or theft of a passport. As such situations are usually urgent, the Director must ensure that the staff of the Office is able to quickly verify the information provided to ensure that the traveler is entitled to a temporary passport or a replacement, or that such a passport could be issued on the basis of personal recognizance and advise the Consular staff at the embassy accordingly. Due to the nature of supporting documentation required, the Director develops and maintains close ties with a variety of Provincial government officials in the various provinces served by the region, the court system and other government organizations. Such relationships are vital to ensure that the information held by each of these bodies and information exchanges are facilitated and that the information accessed by the regional Passport Office is current. The Director must also be familiar with the various provincial laws and regulations, both within the region and outside of it, governing documentary evidence necessary for passport issuance. The Director will also work closely with law enforcement agencies in cases of suspected passport fraud, theft, or misuse of a passport or in cases in which individuals fail to comply with orders to surrender their passport. As the local representative of the Passport Office and the some extent the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the Director undertakes a variety of activities and programs to promote the federal presence in the region, represent the Department and the Passports Office and inform the public and travel industry on passport requirements, changes in regulations and other issues of interest to the traveling public or the travel industry. The Director will either ensure that staff attend various travel association trade shows to represent the Office or do so personally when time permits, to provide information to the public and promote a greater understanding of passport requirements. In any cases of media coverage concerning a matter or issue that affects the operation or any aspect of the regional Passport Offices, the Director will also represent the Office to the media, provide them information and facts and encourage the media to publish information, such as new or changed regulations or requirements, new services or any other subject of interest to the public to enhance their awareness and promote the regional Passport Office. Frequently, these media representations are of a sensitive nature; requiring Regional Directors to balance their responses in such a way that considers the privacy issues of individuals with an obligation to provide accurate information on policies and the reality of the situation. The Director is also a member of the Regional Federal Council. The purposes of this body are to provide the directors of the various federal government departments in the region with a forum to discuss and exchange information which would of general interest, develop cooperative relationships with the various departments, represent and promote the federal presence at the regional level and provide the Privy Council Office and the Clerk of the Privy Council with an independent source of information and advice on the regional situation and events in the region affecting federal activities. The members of the Federal Council in the region also promote closer cooperative relationships and partnerships with the various provincial governments to enhance government service to the local population. As a member of the Passport s Office s Executive Committee, the Regional Director is a 4
Regional Director, full and vital part of the Office s business planning process and the charting of the Office s future direction. The business plan is the Passport s Office blueprint for its objectives, priorities, business methods, resourcing and revenue for the forthcoming year, as well as performance indicators and performance measurements and any other aspects vital to the business of the organization. A major point of discussion for the Office it to increase efficiency of service and document handling while also making the process of obtaining a passport by applicants in remote areas easier, without compromising the integrity of the system and of passports issued. The Director may represent the Office on a variety of interdepartmental committees and task forces with such other departments as Agriculture, Customs, Transport, Citizenship and Immigration and various industrial and tourist associations to participate in and explore methods of passport control facilitation, conduct risk assessments and review the possibility of using enhanced technology to move to less traditional forms of passports. The Director may also design and manage various types of pilot projects within the region on behalf of the Headquarters, assess their risks, cost, performance and feasibility, report on the results, and recommend their adoption on a national basis, further expand trials for testing, or the abandonment of the project. As the international standard for passports is set by the ICAO, new approaches to passports standards, uses of technology and other proposals relating to passports and passport control facilitation will also involve this organization. With the increase in travel throughout the world, passport control facilitation to speed up the movement of travelers has become a major concern, while at the same time document integrity must not be compromised. The use of modem technologies is one possible solution, but some countries may not have the capabilities or means to take advantage of this. Consequently, the objectives of such discussions and arrangements is to gain an appreciation of the position of other countrics with respect to the acceptability of such technologies and explore and gain agreement on the extent to which movement in this direction can be encouraged. The Director cultivates and maintains contacts with Passport Office representatives of other countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to exchange information on procedures and processes, discuss new initiatives in passport documentation, the use of technology, facilitation and control and cost saving measures and the overall direction in which the Passport systems in these countries are moving. Such contacts also provide the means of exchanging experiences and the result of various pilot projects which may have been conducted in these countries, their results, and if they can be adopted to the Canadian situation.

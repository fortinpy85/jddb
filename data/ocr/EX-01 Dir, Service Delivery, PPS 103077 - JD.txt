ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE The Director, Service Delivery, Processing and Payment Services, reports to the Senior Executive Director (EX-O3), Processing & Payment Services. Also reporting to the Senior Executive Director is a number [varies from region to region] of Directors, Processing and Payment Services, within specified geographic centers and business lines.

This service delivery approach increases the accessibility and ease with which anyone needing Government of Canada information and services can successfully obtain what they need when they need it. Service delivery is based on four fundamental Director, Service Delivery, Processing and Payment Services Page I of 5
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada principles: access for all Canadians, an interactive relationship with citizens and communities, demonstrable service excellence, and sustainable federal presence. The Regional programs are managed in a complex framework that provides federal services within an integrated, distributed governance model supporting federal and departmental policy and program development. These regional programs provide, in addition to the pre-existing HRSDC programs, those client services and advice in respect of other federal departments and agencies such as access to passport services and aboriginal health services. The Service Canada Initiative involves more than 6OO points of contact with citizens through a network of offices throughout the Regions. The Regions are organized by business stream and are headed by Executive Heads, Service Management (EHSMs) who report to the Senior Associate Deputy Minister, HRSDC and Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada. The Processing and Payments programs managed represent major funding and processing of large scale payments, benefits, grants and related federal expenditures to Canadians and representing the region's share of over $74 million nationally. The Processing and Payment Services mandate also incorporates the focus for appeals relative to payments under the various program legislative and statutory requirements. This position is tasked with operational management of the processing and payments services for the specified geographic sub-divisions of region, for particular program benefits [El, OAS] or for a combination of specified geographic elements such as B.C. and program such as El]. The responsibilities involve, in some specified combination, the delivery and management of Part I of the Employment Insurance program, Income Security Benefits, Old Age Security, processing payments related to other services offerings and the implementation of legislative/regulatory changes to the income support programs. As part of this accountability, the Director is responsible for the organization of the work and the mobilization of employees in the region's designated Service Canada Processing Centres and the Insurance Processing Operational Centres and Call Centre Operations and Specialized Services Operations for the delivery of the payments in respect of national standards; managing resources and workload balancing; and measuring and analyzing results, and making the appropriate decisions for achievement of regional service standards and performance measurement. The Director is tasked with providing sound operational management of specialized call centres or processing and payments services and for the establishment of processes to ensure that emerging issues and priorities are identified and properly analyzed in order to be able to respond to and manage critical situations and minimize operational risks due to technological and/or circumstantial mishaps such as systems failure (including telephony). Since economic and employment variations that lead to changes in specialized call centres or processing workload are not predictable with any degree of confidence, the Director must anticipate and plan for contingencies that are best able to meet these potential variations. The incumbent's mandate includes obtaining active input from clients, partners and stakeholders in the identification of issues and priorities; the identification of priority issues for discussion by senior management and in the development of planning responses to ensure consistency with Branch priorities, and to provide objective and timely information to senior management. The Director provides a performance control function to ensure standards for service delivery are maintained against Regional and National mandates, goals and objectives. The incumbent is accountable for monitoring performance and identifying key issues as well as arranging the development and delivery of performance reports in the areas of human resources; for levels of client service; and directing remedial measures for less than satisfactory service delivery into Director, Service Delivery, Processing and Payment Services Page 2 of 5
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada cohesive and comprehensive planning and reporting documents that identify and report on service objectives and key priorities. This information provides a comprehensive view of current and emerging management and service issues which outline the department's management priorities and sets out the strategies for achieving expected key results and methods for measuring performance. The reports are used by management in the on-going monitoring and evaluation of performance at a strategic level and to advance and enhance the integrated delivery of the region's services. A key challenge for the Director is in providing operational leadership to ensure that service staff is properly trained in the systems-based (including telephony) protocols, and that they are thoroughly knowledgeable of the essential measures and standards associated with the various statutory regulatory criteria for payment. The context of the work is characterized by a process that is high volume, demanding of focus on detail, and also repetitive in nature, requiring special HR and work arrangements to be set in place to ensure the sustained attention of service staff in order to minimize errors and ensure the highest standard of service to clients. These special HR challenges are even more demanding when one considers the seasonal variations in demanas, the relatively high turnover of staff, and the proportion of seasonal staff. Another key challenge for the Director comes in providing operational management in ensuring that the standards of validation are continually monitored and in directing the appropriate verification and cross checking of the personal information and payment data received through regional offices. The Processing and Payment business stream incorporates a continuing information networking and data exchange with other key agencies that play a direct role in further processing, or use of, this data that is produced within the regional offices. Whether transferred directly or indirectly though the Processing and Payment Services Branch, the data that originates in the Region is accessed by the Canada Revenue Agency and Statistics Canada, and serves as the primary cheque issue instrument for the PWGCS Processing and Payment components. The Director is the key operational officer in ensuring this data s validity and that errors do not occur. Finally, the Director faces the challenge of the increasing number and diversity of benefit programs. The traditional processing and payment services of HRSDC programs of OAS, El, CPP, etc. are being added to by new HRSDC benefit programs (e.g. student loans/grants) as well as those of other partner agencies (e.g. passport services). The data management challenges are even more significant when one considers the nature of the personal data contained within these programs. The Director is the point of operational implementation of associated information security and access protocols. The Director works closely with both national teams across branches as well as area Directors in Citizen Service to ensure the harmonization of services delivery and in establishing and maintaining partnerships with other Government of Canada departments/agencies in the region such as: CRA, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada and Canada Post to ensure effective delivery of its services to citizens. The incumbent may also work with service managers and staff of Integrity Services to ensure quality assurance processes are in place, linking the efficiency of services to their integrity through the identification and mitigation of service related tisks and fraud. This requires negotiation, team/relationship building and organization skills to gain the horizontal consensus on the optimal approaches for regional service delivery infrastructure. The Director also contributes to and cooperates with the Strategic Services Branch in providing input on program evaluation as a result of monitoring performance.

Organization The Director, Social Research is one of five positions reporting directly to the to the Director General. The others are: (I) an Executive Assistant; (2) the Senior Director (EX-2) of Research Project Management, responsible for managing our labour market and skills researcher networks and our Pan Canadian Innovations (PCI) funded policy research experiments and providing overall management of our Policy Research Working Group structures (3) the Director (EX-I) of the Labour Market Analysis and Forecasting Division, responsible for managing our Canadian Occupational Projection System (COPS) model development and forecasting and labour market briefings and development of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models for policy analysis; and (4) Manager (AS-O4) Administrative Services. Reporting to the Director Social Research are two senior positions and staff as follows: (I) Assistant Director of Families, Youth and Children: focussing on child care support, changing family structures and their implications for family income, community development support, and other areas (I2 FTES): (2) Assistant Director, Seniors, Life Course and Disabilities: focussing on population ageing, preparation for and income during retirement, prevention of elder abuse, and managing a major demonstration project focussed on child care services in Francophone minority communities across Canada (I4 FTEs). Nature and Scope: There has been a major change in HRSDC s social policy and program portfolios due to major federal initiatives such as the Social Union and other new government priorities which include: the evolving Federal-Provincial\ Territorial nexus for the delivery of these programs; the current fiscal situation and the associated priority to ensure the affordability, value-for money and fiscal responsibility of policy initiatives and programs in these portfolios; the need to explore new partnerships and working relationships with the l
program that best supports HRSDC s human capital formation, labour market adjustment, work | arrangements and youth transitions policy and program delivery organizations and the decision-making of senior management and the Management Board. There is also a major challenge to harmonize the research priorities, approaches, methodologies and tools of HRSDC with those of OGDs and the provinces, who are involved in, or can influence, the delivery of human capital formation, labour market adjustment, work arrangements and youth transitions programs, as well as with those of other key partner and stakeholder organizations. This prevents duplication, optimizes the use of the research resources and effort of all organizations, standardizes analysis and reporting, lessens the need for extensive verification, and results in final reports and products that meet agreed research and quality standards and are more effectively assimilated by HRSDC's senior and Executive managers, federal and provincial decision-makers, including the Ministers and Cabinet, and the total research community. The Director overviews the standards of quality and professionalism of all research conducted by, or through, the Division and promotes tight quality performance standards and criteria that result in leading- edge research methodologies and which subject research activities, projects and experiments to rigorous quality control at critical points in their conduct. This is also true for work conducted under contract of through joint ventures with OGDs, the provinces, academia and other domestic and international public, private and NGO sector organizations. The research covers a wide and expanding range of child care support, changing family structures and their implications for family income, community development support, population ageing, preparation for and income during retirement, prevention of elder abuse, and support for persons with disabilities. The research applies a range of disciplines and tools including sociology, economics; econometrics, demographics; statistical analysis; surveys; and computer-assisted policy analysis modelling. Increasing emphasis is being placed on designing leading edge experimental approaches to testing the effectiveness of targeted interventions, such as child care approaches. The knowledge and data gained through research and by the development and negotiation of knowledge- sharing arrangements is integrated in the Division's corporate information base. A key role of the Director is to ensure that the generated research findings are widely shared through activities ranging from organization of conferences and workshops to contributing publications, such as Policy Research Reports, Policy Research Notes, Policy Research Summaries, and Medium-Term Planning Diagnostiques, to the departmental research sharing Knowledge Portal . Similarly the Director directs the development of systems to collect, verify. process, analyze, disseminate and broker social research information and data on specific aspects of federal and provincial social policy. A major challenge for the Director is the formulation, initiation and management of new surveys, and associated methodologies, techniques and tools, that are usually conducted in collaboration with domestic and international partners (e.g., provinces, Statistics Canada, OGDs and agencies such as the OECD) due to their scope, cost implications, and cross-cutting relevance for domestic and international policy and program design and development. Given the government's and HRSDC's priority for extensive consultation with clients, stakeholders and partners on policy issues, and the need for a convergence of economic and social policy, many of the research initiatives lead by the Director will involve multi-disciplinary, intra- and inter-departmental, federal- provincial, international and federal-client group Task Forces or Projects. The incumbent will usually lead, or play a major role for, such initiatives (e.g., serving as a major contributor to the federal Policy Research Initiative). These consultative initiatives pose a major challenge to the Director who must be able to: lead them in such a way as to gain agreement on the research approach and methodologies and on the scope and purpose of the initiative; educate involved parties; advocate the HRSDC/federal position; identify problem areas requiring special study; develop mechanisms to ensure the quality and timeliness of the projects and their adherence to HRSDC requirements; and negotiate or develop strategies to gain a consensus on
foreign and domestic governments in addressing similar or correlated issues. 6-Represents HRSDC, for cross-cutting and medium to longer-term strategic policy issues, at national and international conferences, expert committees (e.g., ILO, OECD) and various research institutes (e.g., Canadian Policy Research Networks, the Conference Board of Canada, the Institute for Research on Public Policy). 7-Develops and implements an extensive program of communication of research findings through activities ranging from organization of conferences and workshops to contributing publications, such as Policy Research Reports, Policy Research Notes, Policy Research Summaries, and Medium-Term Planning Diagnostiques, to the departmental research sharing Knowledge Portal . 8-Contributes to the development of new content for existing survey collection instruments or the design of new multi-million-dollar survey instruments in the social policy field, to ensure that the resulting data adequately meets longer-term research needs. 9-Plans and manages the development of annual resource and business plans and the allocation, and control of Divisional expenditures; plans and provides for professional leadership, mentoring and staff development of the human resources of the Division/.

NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. The Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD) develops social policies and designs programs to ensure that children, families, seniors, persons with disabilities, the homeless and those at risk of homelessness, communities and others who are facing social challenges have what they need to maintain their well-being and facilitate their participation in Canadian society. ISSD works to build the Canada-wide early learning and child care system, ensures that eligible Canadians are provided with retirement, survivor and disability benefits, supports the long-term financial security of persons with disabilities, implements accessibility legislation and invests in the capacity of organizations and the non-profit sector to reduce barriers and promote access to opportunities for vulnerable populations. The major programs managed by the Branch are Early Learning and Child Care, Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care, the Old Age Security (OAS) program, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the Canada Pension Plan disability (CPPD) benefit and the Canada Disability Savings Program (CDSP). With the 2O2O Fall Economic Statement, the Government of Canada announced the creation of a new Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care (the Secretariat) to support the design and implementation of a Canada-wide system of ELCC. Situated within ESDC, the Secretariat negotiates and manages the federal bilateral ELCC agreements with provinces and territories; conducts ELCC data and research projects; and provides funding to further innovation and increase access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive ELCC 2
programs and services in Canada. The Secretariat also supports the National Advisory Council on ELCC and ensures close coordination with the ESDC Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Secretariat on inter-related areas of policy development and evaluation. Within this context, the Director, Data. Research and Innovation leads the development and implementation of the Department's Data and Research Strategy, which identifies and prioritizes key areas for data collection and research relating to ELCC. The Director also advises on investments in data and research and works in close collaboration with other ELCC directors to advance the work supporting creation of a Canada-wide ELCC system. As the designated ELCC Data and Research lead, the Director also plays a key role in supporting the work of external experts; provides advice to the Minister of Families, Children and Social development with respect to key ELCC indicators and outcomes; recommends ways to address data and research gaps in relation to the ELCC indicators; and serves as a sounding board to test and discuss ideas on ELCC information, data and research generated through the Department's public engagement processes. In addition, the Director leads horizontal work within the Secretariat, with the Social Policy Directorate and other ESDC branches (Income Security, Employment Insurance, etc.), as well as with Statistics Canada. federal, provincial and territorial partners. the Public Health Agency of Canada, and other stakeholders, to define departmental data and research needs in relation to federal priorities to create a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system. This includes the work to source major high-priority contract surveys and data research projects undertaken in support of the Government's ELCC data and research agenda, as well as the responsibility to direct and oversee administration of the federal ELCC Data and Research Grants and Contributions program which supports Canada s domestic, international and Indigenous ELCC funding streams. The Director also directs the development and delivery of a number of grants and contributions supporting the achievement of federal priorities for the ELCC Sector. This includes the Data and Research grants and contributions program, where federal funding is provided each year to support the conduct of ELCC data and research projects, and the Early Learning and Child Care Innovation Program. where the federal government will provide $IOO million in funding over IO years for eligible organizations to explore, test, and implement new and innovative practices in ELCC. The latter program will benefit children under the age of 6 and their families - and particularly, low-income families, single parent homes, special needs children, newcomers to Canada, under-represented and under-served communities. Other grants and contribution programs for which the Director is accountable include targeted initiatives to build and strengthen Official Languages capacity in the ELCC Sector. The Director faces significant challenges in leading the collaborative work to develop and implement the Department's ELCC Data and Research Strategy, which serves to inform the federal policy and program agenda as it relates to ELCC in Canada. The role is particularly challenging given the lack of consistent and timely data to support evidence-based ELCC policy and program development and the wide variety of ELCC issues/knowledge gaps to be addressed. This work is further complicated by the need to obtain the research data through third party agreements, largely with Statistics Canada where the Secretariat's needs must be accommodated within the framework of the national statistical agency and its statistical standards. Finally, alongside championing the development of the necessary foundational ELCC related data, the Director must establish and support the practices, process and personnel to manage and govern the data effectively and in alignment with ESDC and 3
Government of Canada policies, directives and guidelines. Challenges are also faced in the horizontal work to foster strategic data-sharing agreements with other government and non-government organizations, where doing so will be mutually beneficial and achieve greater economies of scale for all interests. In carrying out the responsibilities of the position, the Director establishes and maintains a wide network of senior-level contacts both within ESDC and outside of the department (i.e., Statistics Canada and other federal departments; provincial and territorial governments; and a number of other stakeholders all of whom have a contributory interest in, and play a key role defining, the overarching ELCC Data and Research strategy).

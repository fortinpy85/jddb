NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the Department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. It is one of the largest and most complex federal departments. It employs over 3O,OOO people and its activities account for almost one out of every three dollars spent by the federal government. The ESDC Portfolio (encompassing the Department, Labour Program and Service Canada) operates within a highly matrixed governance structure and operating model, supporting four Ministers (i.e. Minister of Families, Children and Social Development; Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion Minister of Labour; and Minister of Seniors). Portfolio organizations operate with five (5) distinct sources of funding the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Employment Insurance Operating Account, the Canada Pension Base Account, the Canada Pension Additional Account, and the Passport Revolving Fund, and deliver a large number of diverse programs to Canadians. Overall Portfolio expenditures are projected to be $I38.3 Billion in FY 2OI9-2O. ESDC has a broad mandate that includes social policies and programs, including Labour, and the delivery of a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives. For example, the Department provides seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education, and assists parents who are raising young children. The Labour Program contributes to social and economic well- being by fostering safe, healthy, fair and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the federal jurisdiction. Service Canada helps citizens access ESDC s programs, as well as other Government of Canada programs and services. Additionally, ESOC now has legislative authority to deliver services on behalf of other organizations and must therefore recover costs for these activities, which adds additional complexity to service delivery operations. ESDC is both a policy and a service organization. As a policy department it plays a significant role in the Government's policy agenda which supports delivery of a number of programs, including over 4O statutory grants and contributions programs. The Policy Branch of ESDC is responsible for the policies of all 4O programs delivered by the Department. These programs include CPP, Employment Insurance, and OAS, as well in excess of 4O Grants and Contributions programs. The Policy Branch has 5 separate sub-branches each with its own area of specialty. These are the Strategy and Service Policy Branch, the Skills and Employment Branch (SEB), the Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD), the Labour Program Branch, and the Learning Branch, with total FTEs in excess of 26OO employees. As a service organization", ESDC reaches virtually every Canadian through over 58O of Service Canada's points of service across the country, by phone, in person, or on-line through the canada.ca website. Service Canada, which began operations in late 2OO5 with a mandate to provide Canadians with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits, accounts for the majority of operating results of the Department, employing approximately I7,OOO employees across Canada. Through Service Canada, the Department is responsible for delivering over $I2O Billion in benefits directly to individuals and organizations through such Government of Canada Exec Dir, Debt Management and Innovation Page 3 of 8 April I*, 2O2I
| & | Government Gouvernement : of Canada du Canada programs and services, such as Employment Insurance, Old Age Security, the Canada Pension Plan, Passport Receiving Agent Services, the Social Insurance Number, and the Canada Student Loans Program. The Department also provides $4.8 Billion in funding to other levels of government, educators and organizations in the voluntary and private sectors. Service Canada is currently undergoing significant change to its operations due to modernization efforts, the greater number of grants and contributions programs, and increased responsibilities in the realm of service delivery. Significant large scale projects include the closing of 34 Passport Canada Offices across the country and the incorporation of Passport Canada services in the Service Canada sites. Another project involves modernizing Canada's legacy benefit payments system, and recently ESDC has enacted legislation that enables Service Canada to deliver services for partners (OGDs and external organizations) with ensuing cost recovery agreements. This transition and the subsequent increase in complexity necessitates the evaluation and re-optimization of existing service strategies and plans, as well as financial management processes to accommodate this scale up in responsibility, while maintaining a high service standard and prudent financial stewardship. The ICAAD Directorate of the CFO Branch is responsible for ensuring adherence to general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all 4 sets of financial statements, providing departmental accounts payable and receivable operations, grants and contributions financial monitoring, relocation, proactive disclosure and accounting operations services, as well as the development of departmental financial policies and internal control frameworks, and associated processes and procedures. Within this highly complex environment, the Executive Director establishes the Directorate as the Centre of Expertise in the Department on the recovery and/or write-off of overpayments made to Canadians through its diverse programs, including its Labour Programs (for example, Employment Insurance), CPP and OAS, as well as recoveries from outstanding Canada Student Loans, Grants and Contributions programs, and Phoenix salary overpayments. The Executive Director leads the development and implementation of the framework and strategies for national collections activities and debt write-off; establishes collaborative working relationships with the all program heads in ESDC to solicit their support, define their specific requirements, and advise on the current status of collections activities; builds partnerships and negotiates MOUs with CRA which define their roles and responsibilities where collection activities are concerned; and builds collaborative relations with Treasury Board where their approval for write-off of debts is required, to explain the Department's position. The Executive Director is the Department's lead executive in the management and evolution of its accounts receivable system and the generation of timely and accurate statements of account to Canadian debtors. The Executive Director provides senior executive leadership to teams engaged in daily bank reconciliations, and the analysis of accounts, reconciliation between program systems and accounts receivable system, reconciliation between the general ledger and review of debts for financial hardship cases. The Executive Director develops the Department's negotiation strategy, and is ESDC s lead negotiator, negotiating the terms and conditions of MOUs with CRA. This requires the position to work closely with ESDC s Director General level program heads to understand their requirements and develop key performance indicators for CRA collections activities for each of ESDC s programs. This requirement is ongoing as new MOUs are required whenever new programs are announced by the Government of Canada, and changes are required to existing MOUs when program changes are announced. The work also involves negotiating with CRA executives who may not be receptive to ESDC oversight of their activities. The Executive Director negotiates changes to key performance indicators for inclusion in MOUs with all program heads of the Department in response to external and internal audits. ESDC s National Write-Off and Remissions Review Committee (NWORRC) is comprised of all of ESDC s Directors General in charge of program delivery and CRA representatives, and is mandated to review and approve the write-off and remission of collections in excess of $25,OOO ; to review debts proposed for write-off or remission under $25,OOO for which the Associate DG has delegated approval authority; and to review the write-off of all Canada Student Loans which require Treasury Board approval. The Committee approves approximately $22OM in write-offs and remissions on an annual basis. The Executive Director provides executive leadership to the secretariat of this Committee, and also provides expert financial advice and recommendations to NWORRC to assist the Committee in its deliberations. In cases where TB Submissions are required to obtain approval for debt write-off, the Executive Director provides leadership to a team providing expert advice to the programs for the development of the submissions. Exec Dir, Debt Management and Innovation Page 4 of 8 April I*, 2O2I
| & | Government Gouvernement : of Canada du Canada The Executive Director is also secretariat for the Joint Management Steering Committee (SMSC) which is co-chaired by ESDC and CRA and collectively resolves collections issues (for example, the development of strategies to locate individuals errant in paying back their student loans; or compromise settlements for clients for which CRA has no delegated authority). The Executive Director provides overall leadership to major projects, such as: the merger of the 34 Passport Offices into existing Service Canada sites [which requires the reallocation of significant numbers of personnel, and training of staff to build their capacity in all (existing and merged) services provided by Service Canada; and major transformation and modernization initiatives requiring research into new technology, and the development and prototyping of innovative technologies that can be deployed to improve service and reduce costs, including the use of Robotics Process Automation (RPA) to streamline areas of the business which require a great deal of manual effort. The Executive director provides senior executive oversight to the ongoing evolution of the Department's accounts receivable system. The Associate DG works closely with ESDC s Director General program heads to obtain intelligence on the legislative requirements of their programs to ensure the system addresses these needs. Additionally, the Executive director consults with Legal Services to confirm that systems changes address the various legislative requirements of each program. The Executive director provides executive leadership to systems development, enhancement and release, as well as to system testing, data transfer, conversion and consolidation, and training of staff to maximize the capabilities of the new system. The Executive director also leads the development and implementation of strategies and plans to address systems defects. The Executive Director provides detailed briefings to the CFO and the NWORRC on all collections and write-off activities associated with ESDC's programs, as well as grants and contributions, salary overpayments stemming from Phoenix, and Canada Student Loans. The Executive Director also provides detailed analyses of the costs and status of modernization initiatives and their progress, and the benefits that will be/are realized from their implementation. The Executive Director provides leadership to the development and implementation of strategic, business, financial and human resources plans; and the provision of centralized administrative services to the Directorate of 35O FTEs located both in Headquarters and across the country. There are several challenges for the position. The nature of cost recovery for ESDC programs necessitates close coordination with CRA which requires a significant amount of negotiation to establish clearly defined roles via MOUs. In preparation for the negotiation of MOUs with CRA to engage their services in the collection of overpayments, the Associate DG collaborates with programs heads to establish key performance indicators governing CRA's role for each program. This represents a challenge for the position as ESDC programs are more concerned with ensuring payments are made to Canadians than collection activities. Additionally, CRA executives may not be receptive to ESDC oversight of their activities. The Executive Director requires a great deal of political acumen to bring all these various stakeholders on board. This challenge is exacerbated by the implementation of new or changes to existing programs, as each new or changed program necessitates an amendment to the MOU with CRA for collections activity. The evolution of the accounts receivable system and databases is essential to the ongoing success of ESDC collection activity. However, the systems and databases are not currently integrated which hampers collection activity. For example, the legacy systems that store data for CPP and OAS operate on older software that must be modernized to ensure compatibility with the newer system. This interaction between legacy and modern systems necessitates a patchwork of manual workarounds that negatively impact productivity. This environment represents a significant challenge for the position: as the lead on the evolution of accounts receivable systems for ESDC programs, including Phoenix overpayments, and ESDC G&Cs, the Executive Director must drive change in programs across the Department from a collections perspective which is contrary to their core priority of distribution. Additionally, the Executive Director is challenged to spur innovation and think outside the box in the adoption of leading edge technology (such as RPA) to further ease Directorate workload, increase efficiency, and improve collection activities. Service Canada s programs represent the largest outlay of the government for social services, which has contributed to the relative complexity of its financial management operations. Additionally, Service Canada has far-reaching impact across Canada, including other levels of government, indigenous groups, individual Canadians and recipient Exec Dir, Debt Management and Innovation Page S of 8 April I*, 2O2I
| & | Government Gouvernement : of Canada du Canada organizations. As a result of the extensive decentralization of Service Canada s programs, systems must also be tailored for decentralized program delivery. This complex environment poses a significant challenge for the position in ensuring accuracy of collections and reporting, and provision of associated advice to senior management. Personnel that specialize in finance are highly sought after in the modern marketplace. As financial tracking and tools become more advanced, specialized, rapidly evolving and capable of tracking many more data points, they are increasingly important to modern organizations. Due to this increase in complexity, more financial expertise and a higher headcount is required by organizations. This represents a challenge for the position as the Executive Director must not only work to recruit and retain employees in an environment of high demand and limited supply, but also develop their skills to accommodate the rapidly evolving nature of the work. Service Canada s foundation programs (El, CPP, OAS, etc.) are highly politically sensitive. These programs involve delivering funds directly to Canadians and as such have the potential to cause a great deal of embarrassment and negative publicity if inaccurate collection of overpayments is done. Furthermore, salary overpayments due to Phoenix are highly sensitive. This highly politicized environment represents a challenge for the position as the pressure to ensure collections activities are conducted in a responsible and timely manner is high. A major challenge is to deliver on transformation initiatives, such as Passport Modernization, while relying on executives over which the position has no line authority, to do their part. The Executive Director acts as a facilitator and catalyst to foster buy-in by other ESDC executives to priorities for Passport Modernization, and leads associated change management. The Executive Director provides executive leadership to the provision of secretariat services to NWORRC, and provides authoritative advice to the Committee to support its decision making. The Executive Director also provides authoritative advice to the JMSC. The position is a member of the ICAAD Management Committee, meets with the COE of SAP weekly to resolve systems development/enhancement issues, and represents ESDC with CRA ona regular basis to resolve highly complex and sensitive issues related to their roles and responsibilities for collections on ESDC s behalf. Since March 2O2O, the position is the executive lead on resolving the critical situation resulting from the COVIDI9 pandemic. The position will develop the control framework to recover overpayments from COVID I9 measures implemented by ESDC. The Executive Director is responsible for identifying the potential stakeholders involved and leading the appropriate analysis and consultation efforts involved to handle the problem and develop appropriate recommendations. The COVIDI9 pandemic had a significant impact on debt management. It is estimated that overpayment analysis and recovery efforts can take up to two years. The Executive Director will develop and implement ICAAD's Strategic Human Resources Plan and financial community renewal programs and mechanisms for the Division s 3OO FTEs. The Executive Director supports the DG of ICAAD and DCFO in the establishment of the directorate s human resources priorities and oversees the development of strategic plans.

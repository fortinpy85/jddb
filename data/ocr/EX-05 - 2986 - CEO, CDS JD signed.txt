NATURE AND SCOPE The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) is a key GC central agency led by the Secretary of the Treasury Board (Deputy Minister). It supports a committee of Ministers (the Treasury Board) led by the TB President (Minister), which exercises authority over a vast range of issues across the federal public service. It has four principal activities, acting as: the govemmment s Management Board; as its Expenditure Manager, as the Employer for the Public Service; and as a provider of Regulatory Oversight". The GC, as have a number of governments, has been slow to build capacity, adopt modern practices and tools for designing and delivering services that meet the public s Intemet-era expectations. Many government departments, for example, are using legacy technology that no longer meet the needs of their users and must now also adopt modern technology practices such as cloud and a variety of security best practices. October 8, 2OI9
Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Digital Service V7 7 CDS has been created as an autonomous and neutral organization to support the GC in its commitment to provide the highest quality services and meet the expectations of millions of Canadian citizens and thousands of Canadian businesses in the digital age. CDS is housed within TBS in order to benefit from line of sight across government and close proximity to the policies and standards that drive and scale change. CDS is an organization that is designed to continually evolve, depending on the needs in the system, to help further the uptake of digital government across the GC and its interest. CDS's primary mandate is to focus first and foremost on delivery by helping CPS departments and agencies improve how they design and deliver services to Canadians. It does so by providing hands-on-help and expertise grounded in delivery experience, in partnership with departments, to improve services to Canadians; by helping solve common challenges and scaling solutions across government; and by providing advice to GC and departmental executives about building capacity for and enabling and improving digital service delivery. CDS helps build government-wide digital capacity and literacy and provides advice in a number of areas related to service improvement and technology, grounded in practical experience and global best practices. CDS is also learning from, and working closely with, digital service teams within Canada and intemationally, such as the Ontario Digital Service, the U.K. s Government Digital Service, and the U.S.'s I8F and the U.S. Digital Service, and engaging the digital community across Canada. Within this context, the Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Digital Service, discharges the following accountabilities? As a position with very significant stature, the CEO acts as a high level change leader, exhibiting a mastery of innovative technology, building and delivering digital technology, mainly with CPA partners, and sharing mastery of the latest technological theories and their practical application to effectively partner with clients and gain their trust in moving to the future state. The CEO is the chief CDS storyteller, speaking to GC, national and international parties on digital adoption successes and sharing the latest innovations in digital technology. To accomplish this role, tha CEO must have extensive and deep international experience to draw on and the capacity to act as an evangelistic and compelling storyteller to capture the imagination of potential CPA partners, waking them to the benefits of adopting digital technologies and accepting the practical help CDS offers to achieve their own successes. In the incumbent's neutral role, the CEO also acts as an unbiased challenge agent to remove embedded thinking and provide unbiased feedback on proposed TBS and departmental IT policies and practices in order to ensure they support the realization of digital application, digital transition, and digital capacity growth, and support a demonstrable increase in the velocity of service needed to support the govermment s commitment to Canadian citizens and businesses. Further, the CEO acts as a senior advisor to the highest level decision-makers at the TB andTBS and senior officials across the GC by providing significant and difference-making strategic advice and guidance and candid and uniquely informed counsel on issues related to the mandate of CDS and broad digital transformation initiatives across the GC. All CDS's deliverables must demonstrably improve service to Canadians. A key dimension of the CEO's role is to promote open, user-centred and outcome-based delivery and assessment of 2 It is first important to note that, unlike many TBS senior organizational heads who exercise CPA-wide functional authority, CDS is not a functional policy organisation. It gains its influence through acting with the neutrality of an ombudsperson, able to freely advise, engage and, as required, challenge partners equally from a non-partisan platform built on practical solutions.

The CEO must exercise the highest levels of suasion, at the highest levels, to get business owners to opt in and put their own human and financial capacity into projects and products. At the same time, the CEO is expected to engage past, present and future partners in discussions at the strategic level about improving CDS s own delivery and outcomes, creating balanced and open strategic partnerships. Growing new capacity comes with other commensurate technical and cultural challenges: changing the way service is delivered means changing both the way current employees work and hiring new employees to work in the digital service world. The CEO acts as a key, high level proponent for growing both technical and cultural digital capacity across the CPA, through the provision of advice and guidance that, as noted above, is grounded in very extensive experience and mastery of what works. The CEO leads CDS in promoting GC-wide capacity building-skills and tools, to meet these challenges and in helping others to hire the right people, to work with modern tools, practices and technologies, and to learn through collaboration in helping the GC understand and adapt to these evolving needs. As an example, the CEO cultivates communities where this type of change isn't present by influencing and building support through senior leaders and the executive community at large. The CEO is also the CDSs internal cultural leader, setting the tone for the organization s modus operandi. Of particular importance, the CEO inculcates an organizational culture that intentionally celebrates and highlights partners successes, not its own. For example, it is partners who are to be highlighted publicly as good news stories, for implementing a given product that delivers services in a better, more user-centric way and elevates end user service. Through demonstrating the positive outcomes of change through successful partner outcomes, CDS builds the market for its services. The CEO also supports an agile team concept that partners with government departments to improve services, rethinking service design and delivery from the user's perspective, and engaging users every step of the way. The CEO's role in strategically leading CDS into making the right project/partner choices and determining their priority is critical. CDS resources are limited and the stakes are high. Therefore, the CEO must set broad frameworks within the CDS mandate to ensure good choices. Many criteria affect these choices. Some key considerations are: the impact of the project; savings that result; the seriousness of the current delivery issue (poor service or the public perception thereof); the number of people who will benefit; the readiness of a department to work differently and how much senior management in the given organization is onboard and ready to push for change; and the scalability of the product and its design and research outcomes (e.g. reusable codes). The CEO makes choices, based on the above factors and others as well as on analytical advice from subordinates, but more importantly, on the incumbent's own much larger understanding of the holistic state of play. As an organization that is designed to be flexible and evolve according to the needs of the GC and rapid technological advance, the CEO must view project and partnership decisions, and those for internal product development, through an evolving lens focused by the incumbent's own high level intelligence gathering and understanding of global technology trends and the GC agenda, however and however quickly they may change. Whatever the objective merits of a project or product, it is not of value if it isn t doable within a reasonable timeframe and cost and doesn t represent a visible and demonstrable advance in the GC improved service agenda. To support achievement of the CDS mandate, the CEO sets the broad principles and strategic direction for the development and implementation of a comprehensive communication, outreach and liaison strategy which heavily engages partners at the highest levels, including Deputy Ministers, ADMs, and ClOs of federal departments/agencies, the C!Os of the provinces and other countries, deans of business schools, national and intemational standards bodies, CEOs and October 8, 2OI9
Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Digital Service V7 7 other senior officials of industry leaders in the IT fields, and the heads of national and international business associations which are IT dependent. As noted, as the chief storyteller, the CEO will often be central to this strategy, engaging others and communicating the CDS story and its mission. As a senior leader with a very real understanding of the practical implications of current or proposed central agency and departmental policies on service to Canadians, the CEO acts as a neutral partner in assessing policy direction through the lens of their influence, positive or negative, on practical digital improvements to better end user service. As part of the CEO's neutral role, the incumbent, while acting as a positive force, is expected to regularly challenge and even disrupt embedded thinking (e.g. policy interpretation) and to challenge partners current thinking, ensuring that the GC s digital vision remains at the forefront of technological development. This role creates a very effective feedback loop in the modification or development of OCIO/TBS and CPA-wide departmental functional IT policies and others, ensuring the end user is carefully considered and included in policy promulgation. The CEO builds and leads flexible, multi-disciplinary and expert CDS teams in setting and executing an ambitious agenda, recruiting exceptional talent and building a delivery engine. CDS must also be able to respond quickly to external influences and a changing environment. To ensure this happens, The CEO must maintain an accurate picture of pressures and the current state of government services in Canada, while recognizing and working with the GC's overall approach and appetite for technological change (e.g. positive public recognition, speed of solution, cost, risk of change, partnerships involving, for example, provincial and/or territorial relations and timing), The CEO must assess and re-assess the risks and opportunities going forward in an evolving world, setting realistic and viable strategic priorities for CDS in realizing its current mandate, or in evolving to a new state. Research is a core element of the way CDS works. The research team meets with partner departments and maps out user journeys in order to discover how beneficiaries receive a service. In so doing, CDS researchers leam critical insights into the user experience and how that can be improved as well as how the design of the service itself may be improved. Not all the work of CDS is based on immediate partnerships. As a part of its commitment to digitizing all public facing govemment services, CDS researches and builds products to provide CPA-wide departments with well-designed common services, components, and resources that meet their development needs. Through developing tools that all departments can use to help better their digital service, CDS can significantly increase user efficiencies and bring significant cost savings. Although CDS generally focuses on its own development and delivery role, it is at times requested to provide assessments of proposed major IT projects (often $4O million and up). CDS, through its expert capacity, ensures that the proposed projects are based on user needs, reflect modern technology best practices, and fit with the GC service delivery vision. Externally or internally to CDS, and at all levels of government, the CEO must be the voice of the people CDS serves, passionate about helping teams deliver user-centric products and services. The CEO builds with people, rather than for them, leveraging data and real user experiences as guides. Buy-in, whether internal or external, requires a combination of vision, a powerful capacity to raise and sustain enthusiasm, and the capacity to couple that enthusiasm with a realistic message and a clear understanding of the audience for that message.

\ Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Digital Service V7 6 Environment and Challenges Driving digital adoption, while improving service delivery in large, complex organizations, is a significant challenge. The CEO must offer enthusiasm, while balancing long-term vision, with focusing on delivery. The range of challenges that the CEO needs to help overcome include, but are not limited to: e Policy challenges - Some departmental and government-wide policies are at odds with the adoption of modern delivery tools and practices, hampering the GC s ability to promote user- centered design and iterative, continuous delivery. The CEO must help ensure that policy and policy interpretation are informed by the realities of service delivery. e Process and sunk cost challenges - GC organizations have often invested heavily in the status quo, both in terms of financial investment and in work hours spent developing their current ways of operating. This can pose significant impediments to change. e Security challenges - Doing things differently can pose both real and perceived security risks, but often the greatest security risk is in not changing. The CEO must ensure that CDS works closely with security experts within the GC, and with external partners, to mitigate these risks and demonstrate how changes can improve the efficacy, efficiency and future-readiness of our security frameworks. e Budget challenges - Digital service delivery projects are often budgeted in full before an expert team is assembled and able to develop a full understanding of users' needs, leading to guesswork and unpredictability. The CEO is instrumental in leading CDS in working with the GC and with departments to develop budgets and budget processes that are more amenable to iterative, user research-driven service development. e Political pressure - In order to focus on providing the best possible outcomes for people who use GC services, the CEO must ensure CDS maintains its neutrality by focusing on end user needs, as opposed to the priorities that any particular interest group would like to see as a primary focus.

NATURE AND SCOPE The mission of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that help them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development of policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life's transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. The Minister, HRSDC is supported by a Deputy Minister, HRSDC, a Senior Associate Deputy Minister HRSDC/COO Service Canada, an Associate Deputy Minister, HRSDC; and a Deputy Minister, Labour Program. In terms of respective accountabilities, HRSDC is responsible for policy and program development, Labour Program promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment and Service Canada is the delivery arm of Government programs, services and benefits. HRSDC operates within a complex governance and accountability structure as it must support two Ministers, two Parliamentary Secretaries and a Secretary of State (Seniors) and has complex interfaces for service delivery to Canadians. The combined HRSDC, Labour Program and Service Canada workforce exceeds 26OOO employees located in all tegions of the Country through which the programs and services of HRSDC, as well as r-
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by mail, by telephone or through the Internet. The SIN and the SIR are foundations for HRSDC/Service Canada s commitment to transform service delivery to Canadians and it is imperative that HRSDC continue to build and strengthen the SIN as a safe and secure common identifier since it is to be the foundation for the identification and authentication of individuals to validate identity in a consistent fashion across ail channels and service offerings to provide better and more integrated services with the expected level of protection of individual information. Service Canada will also enhance the integrity of the SIR, which holds key basic personal information to allow for the accurate identification of all SIN holders. Within this environment, the Director General establishes the Identity Policy and Programs Division as the centre of excellence to institute a risk and quality assurance capacity in IdM practices and policies to assist programs and senior management in identifying real identity risks, analyzing root causes, developing mitigation strategies, escalating identity risks where appropriate and ensuring the department is effectively responding to and managing identity risks. He/She must develop and employ the optimal strategic engagement strategy to gain the active involvement of all senior Officials, management and employees in order to operationalize its IdM vision, strategic and business priorities and policy and program frameworks across the department. The DG is responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of the IdM Framework, the foundation for a number of IdM related activities that address inconsistent approaches to the registration, authentication and validation of identity information across HRSDC programs, benefits and service delivery processes and pave the way for new service bundles. An enterprise-wide approach to IdM is required to respond to changing needs and expectations of Canadians for stewardship of their personal information, and ensure that effective program measures are in place to maintain trust and confidence in the Canadian social security system. The DG provides corporate leadership to the design and implementation of an over- arching IdM framework as part of the Integrity Framework; a policy framework for the use and access to the SIN/SIR across government; and a reliable identity authentication 5
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada system that is interoperable with other government departments and with the provinces and the private sector. The identity policy and identity systems provide guidelines about the three major components of the Departments IdM activities: establishing identity, the level and nature of authentication of identity upon registration, and the ongoing authentication of identity linked to benefit and service entitlements to serve as authorization for the access to programs and services. The DG directs the development of the IdM Policy Suite, which paves the way for coherent and consistent treatment of identity across all HRSDC service delivery channels. The DG directs the development of policy instruments with clear parameters for registering, authenticating, and validating client identity attributes, which are essential to harmonizing the service experience of Canadians. The DG ensures a long-term strategic perspective which contributes to enhanced data integrity, privacy and security, strengthened and simplified business practices, greater interoperability with partners, reduced costs, errors and inefficiencies in the Department, and an improved client experience. The incumbent directs rigorous evidence-based and comparative research in IdM, including national and international environmental scans, seeking out and applying the best knowledge and lessons learned to enable value-added transactions such as new bundled activities and other proactive service offerings from HRSDC programs. The incumbent's role also includes leading the negotiating of Information Sharing Agreement s (ISA s), as well as for all IdM policies and standards with the provinces and territories as the lead on Identity Management on behalf of the GoC. The incumbent is also responsible for directing a reliable identity authentication system. The identity systems provide guidelines about the three major components of HRSDC/SC IdM activities: establishing identity, the level and nature of authentication of identity upon registration, and the ongoing national oversight over authentication of identity linked to benefit and service entitlements to serve as authorization for the access to programs and services. The DG is a key national federal leader of the IdM federation, as HRSDC is the largest federal department with the most clients and is at the forefront of national and international trends. Thus, the Evidence of Identity Standard is one of a set of standards and related documents comprising the IdM Policy Suite of HRSDC. This, along with a 6
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada policy framework and other standards and tools, will support integrated, coherent and consistent IdM within HRSDC. The Identity Policy Suite, overseen by the DG, seeks to align the different approaches to IdM across the Department to enhance data integrity, reduce costs, inefficiencies and risks of errors, and improve the service experience for clients. It will also assist the Department to better manage and mitigate risks related to identity theft, the fraudulent use of identity documents, the improper granting of entitlements, the inappropriate allocation of benefits and services, financial losses to affected parties and the breach of an individual's right to privacy. It will also allow the Department to better manage other privacy, legal or security challenges, including those arising from rapidly evolving information technologies. The IdM Policy Suite will also help the Department achieve compliance with the Policy on Government Security and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's Directive on ldM, while responding directly to the Auditor General s audit findings. Finally, integrated IdM will provide the Department with tools to meet the Management Accountability Framework (MAF) requirements for Security. The DG is also accountable for the Identity Assurance Standard, one of a set of standards and related documents comprising the IdM Suite of HRSDC. This, along with a policy framework and other standards and tools, will support integrated, coherent and consistent IdM within HRSDC. A risk-based IdM approach will permit a better focus for security and investigative resources and enables the Department to better manage other security challenges, including those arising from rapidly evolving information technologies and will help strengthen the integrity of the programs, benefits and services delivery processes as well as enable interoperability between programs leading to Departmental savings and ensure the appropriate protection of a client's {individual/organizational) personal information. This standard aligns with the Pan- Canadian Assurance Model and international identity assurance frameworks and standards to maximize the potential for HRSDC to connect to, and be trusted by IdM systems in other jurisdictions and enables enhanced collaboration and partnerships across organizations and has the potential to strengthen how different organizations in an identity federation can work more effectively together. 7
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada A key challenge for the DG is directing the national development and administration of the SIN/SIR operations and in ensuring the SIN as a safe and secure identifier in a consistent fashion across ail channels and service offerings. This responsibility involves the issuance of over I.4 million SINS annually, the maintenance of the SIR with approximately 4O million records, and 49 employees. This systems approach to identity is comprised of the following distinct and inter-dependent components: a) SIN to serve as Client identifier; b) Common Registration and Authentication system; and c) an IM/T system linking client and program information. The management of individual identities enables the development and implementation of enterprise-wide identity standards and involves extensive interactions with senior representatives from the Office of the Auditor General, the Treasury Board Secretariat, Parliamentary Committees and other key partners and stakeholders, and requires the DG to negotiate and update agreements with SIR users. Another key challenge for the DG is directing the development and implementation of the Registration and Authorization (R&A) service which is the crucial control point for clients to access the My Service Canada Account portal, as they are the key enablers to integrating programs and services to respond to the future vision for online service delivery, and are the critical component to ensuring the authentication of the client to mitigate potential fraudulent activity. HRSDC is preparing for the future and will remain committed to ensuring that Canadians have an easy point of access to a wide range of the programs and services they need. To meet this ever increasing demand, new measures will be introduced to ensure that Canadian demand for on-line services will be accommodated without endangering the security of documents. The DG provides the vision for |SBs Business Model and Service Delivery model and processes, practices, and system functionality that will help meet the increasing demand for on-line services. He/she will define and implement strategies and processes for reinvesting monies generated into infrastructure programs (major projects, expansion of service delivery networks etc.) to transform and continually modernize the business, to ensure financial viability and response to client expectations. The DG is also accountable for gaining support of key decision-makers across the Branch; implementing business reengineering of ISBs business model and processes emanating from introduction of new initiatives; defining business processes and workflow objectives 8
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada to achieve desired outcomes; implementing major projects, redesign of ISB portal functionalities, renegotiation of service agreements (e.g. Passport Canada) etc. To be successful in this role the incumbent must develop strong linkages and working relationships with senior managers in Service Canada and HRSDC Branches as well as with external partners and stakeholders such as central agencies and OGDs (OAG, TBS, PCO, CRA, CIC, OPC), provinces and territories, foreign governments, and other external organizations for the realization of various tasks (e.g., with the ClO that will oversee through contractors, the development of IT business solutions and with which the OG establishes governance and reporting processes); to determine and identify gaps in the present authentication and credential services and ensure that new authentication and credential services respond to these gaps; engage the organization, stakeholders, partners and client groups in consultations to facilitate effective business process planning and direction, to conduct process mapping and responsibility assignment, define the future vision and values of the organization, as well as the desired end-state of the new access key. The incumbent must adopt a whole-of-programs planning approach to ensure better alignment between projects; to capitalize on commonalities; and must ensure achievable objectives are established and that the resource strategy, roles, and risks are clarified. The DG plays a major role as the lead negotiator for Information Sharing Agreement's (ISA's), as well as in the establishment of all IdM policies and standards with the provinces and territories on behalf of the Government of Canada; is the lead negotiator of the vital event agreements with the provinces and territories, providing executive direction to the vital events management strategy. As part of the vital events strategy, HRSDC and the DG work with the provinces and territories to enhance service offerings to Canadians, (e.g. integrated services at birth).,allowing many of the necessary transactions with government to be integrated to allow Canadians to apply for a birth certificate, as well as their SIN and associated services through a single joined-up process, thus enabling families, upon death, to inform a range of government departments in one step, rather than separately. The DG is also accountable for the joint federal/provincial/territorial program, Confidential Service for Victims of Abuse (CSVA) on behalf of the GoC including the 9
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada coordination of service for I5 federal departments; the implementation of a pro-active and sustainable mitigation strategy to address ongoing and emerging developments that impact the safety and security of Canadians who are at risk of serious injury or death; and is the Department lead on the provision of secure services to the RCMP and CSIS. The Secure Identity Services provides new identities for at-risk individuals (e.g. those in witness protection or undercover officers etc.) and the DG must ensure that the process for acquiring a new identity is not compromised, and that the information is secure since the consequences for the individual could involve physical harm, including death. The DG provides executive support to the ADM to establish the Integrity Branch as the centre of excellence to institute a risk and quality assurance capacity, culture and governance framework in Service Canada in order to assist senior management in HRSDC and OGD partner programs in identifying real risks, analyzing root causes, developing mitigation strategies, escalating risks where appropriate and ensuring HRSDC and partners are effectively responding to and managing risks. The DG must exert federal influence to ensure the optimal harmonization of strategies and approaches across all partners/stakeholders and jurisdictions concerning the stronger profiling and institutionalization of integrity in public administration. The incumbent pursues this relationship-building approach with other external stakeholders such as senior representatives from academic institutions, think thanks and other organizations to develop state-of-the-art approaches for the development and implementation of innovative and enterprise-wide Integrity frameworks, policies and activities and to provide and exchange expertise to support the enhancement of related theories, principles, methods and practices. The incumbent leads the development and implementation of wide-ranging consultations with these senior officials and is accountable in these dealings and representational activities for acting as the Departments senior representative. The DG must work through a large number of standing and ad-hoc intra and inter- departmental committees and working groups, requiring a high level of tact and diplomacy to achieve the desired results and represent ISB and HRSDC and acts as a key note speaker, chair and participates in national meetings, committees and working groups with senior officials from internal and external organizations to contribute to IO
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada public-service wide and national policy and program frameworks and to promote and defend the Departments positions on the wide range of components associated with Integrity. These activities also allow the incumbent to maintain a current awareness of emerging trends and developments in the operational context of these other parties which is essential for the incumbent to lead the continuous enhancement of the centre of expertise on Identity activities for HRSDC. The incumbent provides strategic, expert and authoritative advice and recommendations to the ADM s, DM's, Ministers and other senior departmental officials on high level and sensitive issues, and directs the preparation of briefing notes, Memoranda to Cabinet and other materials on complex, sensitive and high profile program fraud or abuse, SIN/SIR and other issues. The incumbent manages the Division and its resources in support of Branch, HRSDC and government strategic and business goals and objectives and is a key contributor to the development of the Branch s management philosophy, policy and service delivery frameworks and processes as a member of its Senior Management Team.

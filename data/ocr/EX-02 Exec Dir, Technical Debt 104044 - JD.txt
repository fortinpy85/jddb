ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE STRUCTURE ORGANISATIONNELLE a The Executive Director, Technical Debt reports to the Director General, Business Solutions Innovation. This position is one of three reporting to the DG, BSI. The other two positions are the Executive Director, Intake, Contribution and Employment, and the Executive Director, Benefits and Case Management Solutions. Overall, the DG leads a workforce of about 5OO employees. Reporting directly to the Executive Director, Technical Debt are three positions, as follows: I. Manager of Technical Debt Programme Management is accountable for the day-to-day management and operation of the overall technical debt programme. As the main functions, this includes the establishment and management of the Technical Debt Team, the overall development of IT standards and the elaboration of organizational processes to minimize technical debt in IT solutions and services, and the renewal and maintenance of IT disaster recovery plans for ESDC s program services to Canadians. The estimated staff of this division is up to 2O full-time employees and up to 5 private sector contractors. 2. Director of IT Stabilization and Remediation is responsible for the identification and execution of short-term measures to correct existing deficiencies in IT systems and infrastructure. As a top priority, the Director is responsible for working with Shared Services Canada to identify the highest risk IT equipment (or at end of life), and coordinate the replacement of these assets on a timely basis. Secondly, the Director is responsible for ensuring that IT systems use current mainstream software and tools, wherever possible, and that IT systems management methodologies are modernized and agile. The estimated staff of this division is up to 4O full-time employees and up to 2O contractors and consultants. 3. Director of IT Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning is responsible for the renewal and implementation of comprehensive IT Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans for ESOC s mission critical systems and services. At its core, this team is responsible for the development of suitable IT recovery plans and solutions that ensure the operation of ESDC programs to Canadians in the event of a catastrophic event with the information technologies that underpin the systems that deliver these programs. This function demands a high-level of interaction with IT infrastructure teams at Shared Services Canada, who are responsible for the implementation Page I of 4
of the underlying computing and network infrastructures for the ESDC DR plans. The estimated staff of this division is up to 4O full-time employees and up to 2O contractors and consultants. NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)'s mandate is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to help Canadians live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians quality of life. The Department supports Canadians throughout their lives, by assisting families with spending more time with their newborns, more high quality, affordable childcare options or simply more money to care for their children, helping students finance their post- secondary education, supporting unemployed workers and providing seniors with income security. ESDC is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission to strengthen the social foundations of the country. ESDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities related to the development of Canada's human capital. The Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (ITB) operates in a complex, multi-disciplinary, multistakeholder environment to develop and maintain the information technologies that underpin the delivery of socio-economic pensions, benefits and labour programs to Canadians. IITB ensures the department efficiently pursues their strategic, operational, and transformational agendas through sound, innovative, reliable, and secure IT solutions and services. Of particular importance, IITB supports the management and evolution of the information technologies that underpin the operation of government's most important socio-economic programs, namely Old Age Security, Canada Pension Plan, and Employment Insurance, which delivers a combined I63 million payments to 8 million Canadians valued at approx. $II5 billion annually (estimated at 5.2% of Canada s GDP). Today, ESDC continues to operate program systems that were originally designed more than 5O years ago, and with information technolagies that have not been replaced in 25 years (several of which are now considered obsolete, with minimal vendor support, and scarce skills availability). The ongoing operation of these systems has necessitated the adoption of an application management approach that is dependent on traditional methodologies, and refiant on an aging workforce with the skills and competencies capable of maintaining the systems. In addition, limited funding over the past ten years has led to increasing use of older computing, storage and network equipment. As a result, ESDC is at a high risk of service interruptions to Canadians, especially with its pensions and benefits systems. Industry refers to the sum of these issues as Technical Debt , in reference to accepting future risks and costs associated with the ongoing use of older and uncommon systems, technologies. and methodologies The Executive Director, Technical Debt is accountable for the creation of the Technical Debt Programme focused on launching a formal sustainable departmental framework for managing outdated, unsupported, and/or aging IT systems and infrastructure. The Executive Director, Technical Debt will establish the governance, policies. organization and business plans for eliminating ongoing technical debt as part of IT systems development, operation and procurement. The Executive Director oversees the completion of the application assessments. in collaboration with program branch representatives and the IITB Business Solutions and Enterprise Operations directorates to evaluate the technical debt conditions. This includes the identification of aging IT application components, unsupported software products, end-of- life IT hardware, and any other system component that aggravates IITB's ability to maintain the IT systems or puts the operation of these systems at risk of failure. After the assessment of an individual system is completed, the Executive Director is responsible for the development of a remediation plan to replace or remedy the deficient components, and the oversight of the implementation of the remediation plan by the Business Solutions teams. To address the application and software deficiencies, the Executive Director works with the IITB Business Solutions teams to enhance these components. As individual components are replaced or repaired, the teams rely on the Systems Testing teams to validate the ongoing integrity and reliability of the overall system. To address the IT infrastructure deficiencies. the Executive Director collaborates with the data centre. network, and security teams at Shared Services Canada (SSC), who are responsible for the provisioning and operation of the IT infrastructure. Separate interactions with Public Service and Procurement Canada (PSPC) may be required to address the provisioning of IT technologies not under the scope of SSC. The Executive Director is accountable for the renewal and enhancements to the IT disaster recovery strategies aligned to each individual program branch business continuity plan The primary objective of IT disaster recovery planning is to enable an organization to survive a lengthy interruption in service of major IT components caused by a catastrophic failure (due, for example, to a natural disaster); and. to resume normal processing using backup IT capabilities, based on a predefined business and technology plan. The Executive Director oversees the identification of the specific data protection, data retention, data recovery, and business resumption needs for each individual application. Once completed, the Executive Director translates these requirements into final individual IT systems and infrastructure disaster recovery plans. Page 2 of 4
The Executive Director reviews these plans with Shared Services Canada (SSC), who are responsible for the provisioning and operation of the disaster recovery IT infrastructure. The Executive Director will have separate interactions with Public Service and Procurement Canada (PSPC) to address the provisioning of IT technologies not under the scope of SSC. Once the disaster recovery IT infrastructure has been implemented by SSC, the Executive Director works with the IITB Business Solutions and Enterprise Operations to simulate a real disaster to ensure the integrity of the disaster recovery plan and provide the assurance necessary to ensure the ongoing delivery of services. If the test is unsuccessful, corrections and adjustments are made to address deficiencies and the test is repeated until a full test is successful.

In fact, these systems have not been immune to outages in recent years: - In 2OI8, an outdated number format, built years ago into a CPP IT system resulted in a complete failure of the system until it was repaired. This outage directly impacted Canadians due to the inability to process all CPP workload for a full 24 hours, including the handling of client enquiries to the call centre. - In 2OI6, in an effort to gain efficiencies within the OAS system, a number of enhancements were implemented. Four days after implementation, it was discovered that the code was not behaving as intended and had to be rolled back to the prior version. The rollback and restoration of the data took another four days to complete, affecting OAS processing and service delivery. The changes incorporated simply went beyond the design of the system and caused unintended consequences. - Also in 2OI6, during the upgrade of the El mainframes, outdated code generated incorrect results when executed on the modern mainframes. The upgrades had to be halted for two weeks until an investigation was completed to locate any other instances of the problematic application code. The impact of such outages affect productivity, modernization efforts and in the worst cases, services to Canadians. For example, in the El processing cycles, the pay calculations are generated overnight and payments are issued before I pm the next day. This leaves little time to correct any errors that may occur with the pay processing cycles. Although infrequently, errors have occurred during the overnight processing hours that were not immediately corrected. The consequence is that all payments are delayed by a day, resulting in the late delivery of payments to 7O,OOO unemployed Canadians, valued at approximately $5O million. The impact of a delayed OAS or CPP payment would be even more severe. For example, the large overnight batch processing cycle scheduled every month to produce OAS payments requires the execution of 325 batch jobs in a specific sequence in order to process the six million payments to Canadians, typically valued at over $4 billion. The execution of those batch jobs is carefully monitored by senior IT experts in order to ensure that no issues arise. Any Page 3 of 4

Based on a broad, whole of government perspective, senior officials are provided with the necessary information in a Canadian operating environment that is fraught with interdependencies and interconnections among several jurisdictions.

The incumbent draws on seasoned experience and sound judgement in advising senior officials on the best way to communicate with Canadians on these issues. In this context, the Director, Service Canada Communications provides strategic communications support and issues management to Service Canada s Chief Operating Officer (COO), other senior officials and to the Citizen Service, Integrity Services, Benefits and Integrated Services, and Transformation Management Branches. As well, the incumbent directs the development and dissemination of external communications plans and tactics and provides expert communications advice to the DM/COO and senior management. At the strategic level, the Director establishes the processes, practices, and standards to ensure consistent compliance with Government of Canada and ESDC s communication policies. A key component of the Service Canada Transformation Agenda is to create a plan to make Service Canada the main service delivery organization for the Government of Canada. To do this, Service Canada is building on current partnerships, and making new ones, with other departments and jurisdictions. The incumbent must lead a coordinated approach with other government departments affiliated with Service Canada, such as the Canada Revenue Agency, Veterans Affairs, Health Canada, Fisheries and Oceans and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, to name only a small sample. The Director is responsible of establishing effective working relationships with key stakeholders in communicating on benefits delivered by Service Canada on behalf of others. The Director ensures appropriate coordination and amplification of activities on Service Canada channels. The Director is accountable for the development and execution of Service Canada s strategic and operational communications plans, involving a multi-media, multi-channel approach. This requires consultation and collaboration with the executive management cadre to identify expected communication requirements based on immediate and medium-term Service Canada program initiatives.

The incumbent ensures that transparency is both a media perception and a fact. Another challenge related to media relations is that the Director must convey a sense of urgency to the DMO and COO staff with different priorities, in order to secure cooperation in providing timely responses to media queries. The Director is accountable for the development, implementation, and continuous improvement of Service Canada s issues management communications. In addition to providing Director, Service Canada Communications Page 4 of 8 April I, 2O23

The Director in supporting ESDC s organisational initiatives and projects is challenged with responsibility to ensure messages are successfully communicated to clients and stakeholders. Crisis/emergency communication plans requires establishing the target audience and identifying which media would be the optimal vehicle to deliver the messages.

The Director provides leadership and communications expertise and builds agreement on the overarching priorities for Service Canada s communications plan where attention must be paid to ensure plans are aligned with the major priorities of the Government of Canada. As well, they must embody Service Canada s key corporate strategic and business and program priorities. This requires strategic positioning and negotiation by the Director through bi-lateral and multi-lateral meetings and discussions to gain the understanding and agreement of all parties and overall support for the implementation of communications plans and strategies. The Director establishes the frameworks, processes, and linkages to create an effective communication program for Service Canada that acts as the conduit of corporate messages. This creates an enabling mechanism to provide clients and stakeholders with key directions, decisions, and orientations from the COO. Further, the Director leads and manages the dissemination of key information where the nature of communications requires continuous contact with the office of the DM/COO to provide support and advice in determining messaging that will evoke the optimal reception and understanding by general and specific audiences. The Director is the delegated representative of the Director General at Service Canada s communications-related meetings, working groups and other fora. Communications requirements of Service Canada are demanding in that it is a high-profile federal service provider with increasingly high demand during and post-pandemic, coupled with a shrinking workforce.

The breadth of available assistance to these groups is quite extensive and consequently, the incumbent must be well-informed about various programs and initiatives to ensure that Service Canada s products and messages are current, clear and complete. As well, the Director leads the development and implementation of creative approaches to reaching vulnerable and marginalized populations lacking traditional communications capacities. The Director builds and maintains collaborative relationships with the office of the DM/COO and executive managers across PASRB to consult, collaborate and provide communication support services and advise on media and platforms used.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE: The Director is one of four Executive positions reporting to the Senior Director General, Marketing and Communications. The others are the: Director General, Communications Operations; Director, Corporate and Creative Services; and the Director General, Marketing and Research. Reporting to the Director are the Managers of: Strategic Planning and Management Services. Other reports include senior officer, Special Projects, and four administrative staff in the Sr. DG's office. NATURE AND SCOPE: Service Canada integrates services from a number of federal departments to form an easy-to-access network of multi-channel service delivery through a national network of call centres, mobile outreach, Internet-based services and traditional mail and paper channels. These services touch all aspects of the lives of Canadians: from parental and pension benefits, to matching employers with job seekers, applying for a passport and obtaining a Social Insurance Number. This network brings together 32O points of service in communities throughout Canada; a national I-8OO-O-Canada telephone service providing Canadians with information about all federal government services; and a range of on-line services. In 2OO6, Service Canada's points of service will double, reaching I.25 million more Canadians and giving access to many remote and rural communities previously under-served. One of the primary ways this will be done is through mobile outreach - scheduled or in response to a particular need -- by travelling Service Canada representatives. The new model of service delivery also includes the development of effective service and referral linkages to provincial, territorial and municipal governments. A critical feature of the Service Canada vision is the idea of |
managing the service strategy and the resulting integrated delivery network on an enterprise-wide basis, encompassing almost all interactions between the Government of Canada and citizens. The Marketing and Communications Branch of Service Canada delivers a complex mix of plans, strategies and services in support of all program Branches, through a Headquarters and Regional network. The Branch is a focal point for the planning and delivery of advertising, branding, consultation, surveying and media relations activities, and some services are delivered through Memoranda of Understanding with other federal partners, notably HRSDC. The Sr. DG and senior managers of the Branch are involved with consultative and decision-making networks with all levels of government, and play a corporate challenge role across government in promoting the concepts and mechanism of integrated service delivery, which is the new organization s reason for being. To provide integrated planning, analysis, and reporting for the organization, the position of Director, Strategic Planning and Management Services has been created. The Director provides integrated business and human resource planning, monitors and ensures adherence to established corporate/Branch priorities, manages planning and reporting frameworks and processes, and provides executive advice and support to the Sr. DG in her/his management roles at the Branch and organizational levels. The Director develops and manages the Branch s integrated planning for its human and financial resources, and ensures that the procurement and logistical services required to support national networks and activities are provided effectively (e.g. national contracts for advertising services). The Director's roles include: providing a core capacity for a Strategic and integrated planning approach to ensure the coordination of Branch priorities, orientations and frameworks; leading cross-cutting files as assigned by the Director General and/or client ADMs with respect to jointly delivered business activities e.g. planning network; leading the development and implementation of resource management and financial control frameworks including accountability, planning, information analysis, resource management, change management, business continuity, and operational policies and tools; the development of the Branch s strategic and business plans; development and oversight of DG/Director-level performance accords: the development of the Branch s risk management plans and processes; maintenance of the Branch Management Accountability Framework; and executive support to the DG's and Sr. DG's participation in consultative networks and senior management bodies within and outside Service Canada.

The Director plays a key role within the Branch for establishing and maintaining a strategic planning framework for analyzing the priorities and policy directions of all Directorates, for reviewing and analyzing their resource allocations, identifying gaps and overlaps, and for guiding the coordination and integration of their respective positions in policy briefings to the Branch senior management team. The position has a significant advisory role at the Sr. DG and DG levels, with a mandate to identify emerging issues and trends affecting the Branch s and the organization's directions. The Director is responsible for maintaining the accountability, monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks for the Branch, and identifying opportunities to harmonize efforts at the Branch and Regional levels. This role includes responsibility for providing a senior-level challenge role to ensure the consistency and coherence of policy documents requiring the approval and/or intervention of the Sr. DG. The Director is responsible for managing the Sr. DG's Office. This involves developing business plans, budgets, and human resources requirements of the Office, and establishing priorities in order to control the demands made on the Sr. DG. The work also requires meeting with key stakeholders at ADM and DM levels of partner agencies, ensuring a complete understanding of their positions and issues, and providing briefing notes, advice and information to facilitate the Sr. DG s strategic planning and decision making. The Director provides the Sr. DG and Branch managers with an authoritative overview of cross-cutting communications, marketing and management issues, which involves conducting the detailed assessment of a number of major files.

The Director is therefore ideally placed to advise the Sr. DG on the inter-related aspects of marketing and communications policy, management, and governance issues with partner agencies. When a project affects all the Directorates of the Branch, or all Branches of the organization, such as developing responses to major initiatives such as the Public Service Modernization Act and related HR legislation (PSEA), the Director undertakes the development of horizontal issue management frameworks to maintain effective consultative linkages across all Directorates and/or /Branches, and to coordinate these initiatives. The incumbent will manage assigned projects and advise on issues such as: the analysis and management of business cases submitted by Branch officials, or the impact of new policy and program drivers (such as Expenditure Review exercises) affecting the horizontal roles of Service Canada. 3
For each functional area (such as HR, accommodation, procurement, ATIP), the Director is faced with the same set of challenges: to provide strong strategic direction and coordination by working closely with functional areas e.g. HR, finance, FAS; to recommend or determine the most appropriate service provider; and to negotiate and broker shared service agreements to provide the Branch with the services required and to manage funds, including cost-sharing arrangements with Regions and departments, and purchasing of goods equipment and services on behalf of the Branch. Included in this mandate are complex multi-year service contracts (e.g. with advertising firms) used by managers in HQ and the Regions. The Director identifies opportunities for, and establishes strong linkages, networks and working relationships with officials in central agencies and other departments and chairs and/or participates in meetings, committees and working groups with officials of other Branches and central agencies (e.g. PSC, OAG, PSHRMAC) to represent the positions and interests of the Branch. The Director also contributes to the evolving policy discussions of the new organization through membership in various committees and working groups. As the leader on integrated planning and accountability portfolios, the Director provides authoritative advice and recommendations to the Sr. DG and Directors General on issues related to risk management, MAF, etc., and coordinates the preparation of Cabinet Memoranda, Treasury Board Submissions, briefing notes and presentation materials on issues affecting the Branch. The Director is accountable for establishing and developing an organization which is supportive of the overall vision of the Branch, coordinating the definition of the Branch s priorities and business activities from both strategic planning and resource management perspectives; developing tools, processes, and programs required to ensure integration; and directing the review of marketing and communications issues which cut across the Branch s business lines. The work requires thorough knowledge of the theories and principles of communications, social marketing, advertising, and of the principles and methods of human and financial resource management, project management, and business planning, to provide a comprehensive executive support role to the Sr. DG and managers of the Branch, and to ensure the coordination of national initiatives with the Regions. Change management and culture are key tasks that this director performs. These efforts include developing proactive professional development programs to ensure recruitment and retention and development of Branch employees (primarily the IS category and AS category). Other change management processes include organizing and developing regular all-staff meeting, enhancing internal communications with the Branch by finding innovative methods for all employees to connect with senior management, developing techniques to build a culture that is supportive of learning, etc. DIMENSIONS: FTEs 9 4

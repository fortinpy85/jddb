NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is a large and complex federal government department with the greatest impact on the daily lives of Canadian citizens. ESDC is overseen by four federal Ministers and operates under the direction the Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development, the Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development and Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada, the Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development, the Deputy Minister of Labour, and the Chief Transformation Officer. The Department provides a wide range of programs and services that support Canadians at all stages of life such as seniors, unemployed workers, parents raising young children, and students. The Department fosters inclusive growth by providing opportunity and assistance to Canadians with distinct needs, such as Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, homeless people and recent immigrants. ESDC oversees labour relations, occupational health and safety, labour standards, employment equity and workers compensation in the federal jurisdiction and delivers programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies, such as Passport services for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and to veterans on behalf of Veterans Affairs Canada. ESDC also designs and delivers a number of Government of Canada programs that provide benefits for Canadians, including Employment Insurance, Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, Canada Student Loans and Grants, Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program; the Wage Earner Protection Program; and more recently, the Canada Emergency Response Benefits provided to assist individuals and employers experiencing income loss/financial hardship due to the 2O2O global COVID-I9 pandemic. Service Canada delivers many of ESDC s programs and services through its integrated national service delivery infrastructure (approximately 6OO delivery points) which serves as the primary point of contact for persons seeking information or to access Government of Canada services and benefits. Services are provided online via the Internet, through Service Canada s Specialized Call Centres across Canada. Page 2 of 6
Service Canada continues to build its capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for services, in particular through strategic partnerships with other levels of government and community service providers to achieve cost economies and better serve local communities. It is within a context of increasing demand for services, that the Director General, Youth Service and Learning is accountable for directing the policy work, program design, stakeholder management and communications for the Youth Service and Learning programs, designed to provide equitable opportunities for all learners and youth to gain the education, service opportunities and skills they need to successfully participate in a changing labour market and assist while also providing them with opportunities to solve social challenges and make a difference in their communities. The DG directs both components of the Youth Service and Learning (YSL) programs which includes the Canada Service Corps (CSC) and the Supports for Student Learning Program (SSLP). For CSC, that means working with stakeholders to deliver a number of youth service placements through community engagement and volunteering opportunities to develop skills and to promote greater civic engagement and inclusion. For SSLP, that means working with stakeholders to provide youth with early intervention and after school supports to help them succeed in their studies and transition and succeed in PSE. The DG leads policy and program development to create equity of opportunity so that all students can access supports to improve their educational attainment, and acquire the skills that will help them successfully transition to the labour market. In support of these objectives, the DG leads policy analysis and research, engages and collaborates with partners and stakeholders, as well as develops strategies in collaboration with expert organizations to test innovative solutions and to evaluate the direct impact of initiatives. The DG is also responsible for the design of the YSL policy related elements for the Youth Digital Gateway, working closely with ESDC's Transformation, Citizen Services and Technical support branches, and broker partnerships with outside organizations to support youth digital services and tools through research and evaluation in order to learn from the results of the innovative approaches being employed as well as the impact and reach of the Youth Service Portal. One of the many challenges facing the DG, YSL is the responsibility to provide executive leadership for the design and oversight for the implementation of the national scale project stream delivery and the administrative capacity of established youth-serving organizations to support innovative national scale projects, ensuring pan-Canadian availability of service and learning opportunities. The DG is accountable for several complex YSL program elements to support and recruit young Canadians to strengthen youth resiliency and undertake service projects in communities focused on promoting civic and democratic participation, foster service excellence and encourage innovation. The YSL program youth activities will target proposed areas of focus such as reconciliation between Indigenous and non-indigenous youth, building an inclusive Canada and preserving the environment. In order to effectively communicate the necessary YSL operations and strategic priorities on this national scale project, the DG will act as a bridge to address ongoing issues with clients, stakeholders and partners, including the Regions and provinces/territories, given the operational reality and the divergent perspectives held by the multitude of organizations and parties involved in the YSL s sphere of service delivery. As such, the DG serves as a key member of any corporate initiative taken by the Branch or the Strategic Policy Branch for the YSL program portfolio, and, in this regard, provides knowledgeable information and expertise related to the real program delivery conditions, the context and positions and priorities of the many parties involved. The incumbent's contribution is central to the development of required consensus that will be supported by all ESDC components, the central agencies, OGDs, other levels of government; non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and key client and stakeholder groups. In developing the Directorate s integrated and coherent operational policy role and YSL service delivery frameworks and machinery, the DG ensures their responsiveness to the new government policy agenda and ensures these frameworks fully reflect the evolving regional realities, F/P/T partnerships and arrangements, and other domestic issues. The incumbent discharges a strong leadership role for the Page 3 of 6
portfolio not only within Service Canada and ESDC but also across the federal government. It is essential that the DG achieve partnerships and working relationships with the central agencies and OGDs concerning the YSL to harmonize federal policy and program effort and capacity while avoiding duplication. In order to optimize the Directorate s success in implementing its varied and demanding mandate, the DG leads the development of client-focussed, results-based national plans and performance measurement, accountability and reporting frameworks which in many cases must reflect the priorities and interests of partner organizations. This activity requires extensive liaison within ESDC, involved corporate Branches, the Regions and external partners. This ensures that the opinions of these key players are adequately considered and reflected in these critical management processes which are key to the monitoring and evaluation of the national operational policy orientation and program/service delivery as well as to the quality of the reporting to senior management and the provision of advisory services for issues requiring their attention and/or action. The DG must facilitate and negotiate acceptance of Gs&Cs with NGOs, community resources and other partners in the communities and regions while maintaining the expectations of clients and stakeholders for continuing federal leadership and presence. This is a sensitive undertaking given the opposed and usually divergent positions of the provinces/territories. This melding of perspectives, along with an understanding of stakeholder positions, concerns, capacities and limitations is required to gain consensus on new, innovative operational program policy concepts and orientations, the development and provision of strategic advice, representation and negotiations, and the development of position papers, policy proposals, agreements and other high-level documents for the ADM, Senior ADM, DM and Ministers. These activities often result in the formulation of submissions to the central agencies, Memoranda to Cabinet, and Treasury Board Submissions in which the DG is a key contributor and participant. The DG, YSL is also accountable to direct the Program Operation Branch within ESDC to solicit and assess proposals on grants and contribution funding with youth serving organizations across Canada who support learning and service opportunities for youth and make recommendations for funding to the Ministers responsible for CSC and SSLP. In carrying out the responsibilities of the position, the DG, YSL establishes and maintains a wide network of contacts at the senior levels of government and in this capacity directs communications support for announcements and communiques about the YSL by the Prime Minister, as well as the responsible Minister for the programs as well as fosters and strengthens the Department's business relationships with partners and stakeholders and forges strategic partnerships to advance the Department's priorities. As a member of the ESDC senior executive team the DG, YSL contributes substantively to the achievement of the Department's strategic outcomes and priorities; serves as a Strategic advisor to the Assistant Deputy Minister, Learning on emerging issues and developments with implications for departmental priorities and the business lines engaged in delivering youth benefits and services with commitments to improve the operational capacity and preparedness of the Youth Services and Learning.

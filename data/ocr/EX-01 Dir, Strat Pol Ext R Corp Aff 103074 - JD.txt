| Cg | Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada NATURE AND SCOPE The mission of HRSDC is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development of policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life s transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. HRSDC, through the Service Canada Initiative, supports Canadians and their communities by providing citizen-centered, quality service through a network of people partnerships and technology that helps Canadians access the full range of Government services and benefits. The delivery of government services and programs is complex because of the broad scope of the programming involved, the number and diversity of the clients served and their needs, and the multiplicity of stakeholders and partners involved. Service Canada helps simplify citizen access to Government services and programs and increases the accessibility and ease with which those requiring Government of Canada (GoC) information and services may successfully obtain what they need, when they need it, and in a way that is convenient to them. Service delivery is based on four fundamental principles: ensuring access for all Canadians; developing an interactive relationship with citizens and communities; demonstrating service excellence; and providing a sustainable Federal presence. The regional organizations of Service Canada represent the primary focal points for Service Canada and the delivery of services and benefits to Canadians on behalf of the GoC. The EHSMs are supported by Executive Directors who are each responsible for managing a designated business line. The Strategic Services Branch provides corporate leadership to the achievement of service excellence and better outcomes for Canadians by managing internal and external strategies regarding corporate and regional goals and activities; managing the regional planning framework in alignment with national planning activities, managing a strategic federal-provincial and external relations framework, and managing responsibilities related to the Privacy Act. It is within this context that the Director, Strategic Services, External Relations and Corporate Affairs is accountable for leading the facilitation and engagement of key partnerships with federal-provincial and external stakeholders, engaging in extensive consultation, advocacy and negotiation activities to effectively converge the corporate vision and business lines on the policy-service delivery continuum (vertically and horizontally). The Director provides an integrated, regionally focused, strategic, and analytical policy and planning capacity for the policy-service delivery continuum, and a focal point for region-related horizontal and business transformation analysis and development to facilitate a more cohesive approach in national forums to Service Canada's federal policies, programs and services that impact the Region and, where appropriate, to integrate regional perspectives and realities. The incumbent manages the integration of strategic intelligence and advice, managing governance processes for inter-governmental management committees with other departments; manages the departmental statutory responsibilities of the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Director, Strategic Policy, External Page 2 of 7 Relationships and Corporate Affairs
| Cg | Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada legislation; and manages the resources of the division. The use of partnerships in the co-management and delivery of Government services, benefits and programs is a common practice and such arrangements are entered into with other federal departments and agencies, other levels of government and non-government organizations (NGOs) who have governance accountabilities for selected communities. In this capacity, the Director is accountable for managing the governance responsibilities for federal-provincial agreements, acting as the point of contact for the province, including for the overall administration as well as the negotiation of new agreements or amendments to existing ones. He/she participates, leads and/or co-leads on joint federal-provincial working groups, taking a hands-on approach to these activities. In support of key federal policies and the ministerial mandate, the Director takes a lead role in forging strong consultative networks and partnerships with key partners and stakeholders (e.g., Federal Councils, other government departments (OGDs), the Province, municipalities, voluntary organizations), enabling liaison and engagement to share knowledge, best practices and information, influence priorities and program/resource efforts and to identify these parties priorities and positions. The incumbent facilitates the development of regional networks to improve the support provided to the Region and NHQ branches required for the coordination of strategies and approaches on issues and relations in the Region with OGDs, the Province, municipalities, and key stakeholders. These networks allow the Director to coordinate strategic direction and to manage and oversee the implementation of horizontal service delivery initiatives and obligations. The Director leads business transformation processes, implementing frameworks and strategies to help transform and continually modernize regional business practices to ensure service excellence in the delivery of services/programs and that they are consistent with the Department's functional direction, that they meet business needs and respond to demand for services. The incumbent is accountable for the integration of transformation objectives into communications, accommodations and human resources (HR) decision making processes, and must draw the link between the organization s vision, and regional strategic plans and future business orientations, providing a focal point for manageable transition in terms of values, priorities, policies, processes, organizational models and systems. To accomplish the assigned mandate, the Director faces a significant challenge in, not only, developing a critical relationship/linkage with the EHSM and all the stakeholders, but also in representing the Region's interests through creating a focal point for Service Canada issues within the Region, and in maintaining a current knowledge of their priorities and positions and of major factors in the operating environment that require possible action by HRSDC/Service Canada. The relative importance of establishing these strong consultative and intelligence- sharing networks within Service Canada, the Federal Council, and with key federal departments and agencies are, therefore crucial, in order to engage regional and community organizations in knowledge sharing and dialogue and to support the processes of proactive consultation, knowledge and information networks. These networks provide the Director the opportunity to remain current and address issues based on current events, future trends and ancillary activities and initiatives by other levels of government, and for the development of high quality regional forecasting information in support of the policy-service delivery continuum (vertically and horizontally).

| Cg | Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada The challenge for the Director in acting out his/her extensive representational responsibilities is further heightened where HRSDC/Service Canada s policy and program files cut across the mandates, directions and activities of provincial and municipal jurisdictions who also have their own range of policies and programs that directly or indirectly affect departmental priorities. The acquisition of strategic intelligence and the provision of advice are thus crucial when developing initiatives. The Director must seek out and support the acquisition of regional research/intelligence necessary for the development of critical strategic policy visions and agendas through consultation with corporate branches and key external players in order to be able to provide input at the conceptualization and design stages of service strategies in conjunction with the business streams, as well as at early stages of policy and program development. The Director provides support in the Region to departmental officials in identifying and engaging partners at all levels to reach a common end on horizontal issues within the Region, and for developing an integrated, achievable vision for an effective HRSDC/Service Canada presence in the Region.

This also serves to enhance the capacity of NHQ and partner departments policy branches to conduct regionally focused policy research and analysis, planning and monitoring activities within their respective areas. The Director identifies potential models of collaborative program planning and delivery to promote the horizontal approach to operations to allow for more coordination and integration across HRSDC/Service Canada s policy, programs and investments and, where appropriate, to enhance the integration of regional priorities into these frameworks. The incumbent's support is critical to leading the development of HRSDC/Service Canada's research/knowledge agenda and frameworks through the development of improved information gathering processes, and in engaging regional networks, stakeholders, OGDs, experts, academics, and federal/provincial/municipal interests. The Director is a major player in providing coordination of the overall federal effort in the Region, and managing regional governance processes for inter-governmental management committees and integrating strategic intelligence and advice in the initiatives of the regional federal councils and committees and other regional interdepartmental strategic alliances, ensuring alignment with corporate priorities. The incumbent plays a crucial role as a departmental representative when interacting with the Council and leads projects to engender greater cohesiveness in overall federal policy and program orientations and strategies in the Region. The Council places a strong emphasis on federal policy/program integration and harmonization at the national and regional level since it operates under the guidance of the Privy Council Office, requiring the Director to advocate departmental perspectives and ensure policy alignment with the GoC s which are key in the policy-service delivery continuum (vertically and horizontally) priorities. The Director establishes an issues management framework, including strategies and processes to support policy functions and information/knowledge management.

The Director is accountable for supporting NHQ s strategic and future-focused capacity, while at the same time, ensuring that there is an issues-specific response capability. In addition, the incumbent must capitalize on opportunities for co-operation and multi-lateral collaboration to resolve issues that require HRSDC/Service Canada or government-wide attention. In overseeing this function, the incumbent must ensure that necessary consultation is undertaken, a balanced and informed approach to critical issues is developed, and that, even in the face of severe time constraints, the responses are well thought out and do not exacerbate the situations. This is essential to attain an intra- and interdepartmental and national consensus on HRSDC policy priorities and processes. The EHSM and Senior Executive Director call upon the Director to provide expert, sound and frequently immediate advice on sensitive issues which impact directly on the Department's policy and planning agenda related to the Region.

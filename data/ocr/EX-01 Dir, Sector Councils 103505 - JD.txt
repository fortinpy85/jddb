NATURE AND SCOPE Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSNC) is a key pillar, within the new government structure, policy agenda and service delivery context for achieving the Govermment s goals to build a 2Ist century economy for Canada and to strengthen Canada s social foundations. HRSDC provide leadership I ]
aw! focal point for federal economic, labour market and social programs and activities relating to: the development of Canada s human capital; the promotion of an efficient labour market. including new fedcral-provincial/territorial labour market frameworks; the leadership and promotion of workplace skills development, including stronger linkages and partnerships with employers; enhanced access to post secondary education: the value of lifelong learning; the delivery of all income benefits through the national service delivery network s in-person service channel; and the regulation, faimess and health and safety of Canadian workplaces. The department is also accountable for developing shared strategies and programs with partners and stakcholders to alleviate homelessness in Canada. The department, with over I4,OOO employees, administers over $I8 billion in spending including the Employment Insurance Part | and II income benefits, student loans, and various funding programs related to labour market inclusion, employability, skills and workforce development, lifelong leaming, literacy and specific client groups, such as Youth, Aboriginal, and Official Languages Minority Communities. HRSDC has a broad mandate to examine approaches to strengthen Canada s economic, labour market and social foundations and to establish new partnerships to create strategic approaches to respond to the emerging cconomic and labour market needs of Canadians. This involves an agenda to create new stratezic v and program policies and services benefits to provide clients with the opportunities and tools to achieve their full potential and participation in the labour market and the community, and to share in, and benefit from, Canada's prosperity. The Workplace Skills Business line involves three major spheres of activity and accountability: Human Resources Partnerships (including the Seetor Council Program. Apprenticeship. Red Seal. Labour Mobility, borcign Credential Recognition, the NOC and Essential skills), Foreign Worker Program, and Labour Market Information. These are designed to support federal efforts for the economic and social development of all Canadians and to their participation in the workplace. Human Resources Partnerships (HRP) roles will take on increased significance due to the increased emphasis on intergovernmental and | govermnent-stakcholder partnerships across all levels of government, and the Government of Canada s prioritics on Foreign Credenual Recognition and Apprenticeship. These are essential in order to enhance interprovincial worker mobility and to attain truly national accreditation and apprenticeship through the Red Seal program and other mobility initiatives. At the same time, the existing Labour Market and Employment information products (c.g. the National Job Bank) and their respective management processes, systems and practices have been adapted to the directions and priorities of HRSDC. The Human Resources Partnership (HRP) Directorate supports these activities by conducting national sectoral studics to provide information on public and private sectors, their work activities and performance, knowledge and skill sets and other human resources development issues, and to identify current, medium and long term employment opportunities. These studies also identify current gaps in information on occupations and work performed in the various public and private sectors and critical human resources and knowledge/skill gaps or workforce shortages requiring collaborative action between the department. other federal and provincial departments/ministries, affected industrial sectors and involved public and voluntary sector organizations. The knowledge and information determined through sector studies and national occupational and human resources research projects facilitates the establishment of Sector Councils and influences and enhances the reorientation and relevance of the national education, learning and training systems, and the conduct of major apprenticeship and other Interprovincial employment mobility and standardization undertakings. Similarly the Sectoral and Apprenticeship activities are key sources of data and information for the National Occupational Skills Information program and trigger constant updates to the National Occupational Classification and JOBSCAN systems. The synergy between these three pillars 2 Z

In this context, the Director, Sector Council Program, is the official responsible for ensuring an effective linkage between the knowledge base created by the HRP and the human resources planning and strategic visioning of a range of industrial Sector Councils. Sector Councils serve as a mechanism to develop and sustain interfaces between the private sector, the national education and learning system and involved voluntary sector organizations. The Sector Council Program assists these organizations to develop collaborative relationships which optimize the relevance of provincial and territorial learning systems to the evolving skills and knowledge requirements of the workplace. The Program also provides support to enhance HRSDC s array of employment/employability strategies, and creates the dynamics and linkages to best deal with the employment and job market requirements, challenges and opportunitics provided by emerging industrial sectors ( .g., biotechnology, pharmaccuticals, microtechnology, ctc.), the expansion and redirection of the public sector (e.g-health, child and senior care) and the increased importance of the voluntary sector as a partner in the provision of public services. The Director, SCP provides leadership in the development of national strategies. policy/program frameworks and the Sector Councils and other networks and partnerships required to deal with the constantly evolving employment market and changes in the workplace.

The Director also ensures that the industrial intelligence (e.g. knowledge about international trade issues such as tariff structures and other factors affecting the sector) and related occupational, cross-sectoral, career development studies required for the operations of the Council is provided by Division staff. The Director faces ongoing challenges in reviewing and monitoring the work of existing Sector Councils, and in evaluating their capacity to build collaborative human resources strategies with industry and provincial/territorial governments. He she must measure their progress towards becoming exemplar | Sector Councils yearly and determine: how they are representative of their industry; how they respond to industry needs and challenges: the degree to which thes are connceled to the learning system and how they | influence it_and that they demonstrate Lanzible results.

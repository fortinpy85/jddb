NATURE AND SCOPE Treasury Board is a unique Cabinet Committee whose powers derive from the Financial Administration Act that provides the framework for government management and which is responsible for accountability and ethics, financial, personnel and administrative management, comptrollership, approving regulations and most Orders-in-Council. The President of the Treasury Board chairs the Treasury Board. The President carries out his responsibility for the management of the government by translating the policies and programs approved by Cabinet into operational reality and by providing departments with the resources and the administrative environment they need to do their work. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) is the administrative arm of the Treasury Board. TBS is dedicated to ensuring the effective and prudent management of the Government of Canada s human, financial, information and technology resources in a manner that best supports the government's objectives and priorities. As the administrative arm of the Treasury Board, the Secretariat has a dual mandate: to support the Treasury Board as a committee of Ministers, and to fulfill the statutory responsibilities of a central government agency. The Secretariat recommends and provides advice to the Treasury Board on policies, directives, regulations, and program expenditure proposals with respect to the management of the government's total resources. Its responsibilities for the general management of the government affect initiatives, issues and activities that cut across all policy and program sectors subject to the Financial Administration Act. The Canadian Digital Service has been created as an autonomous and neutral organization to support the Government of Canada (GC) in its commitment to provide the highest quality services, to meet the expectations of millions of Canadian citizens and thousands of Canadian businesses in the digital age. CDS is housed within the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), to benefit from line of sight across government and close proximity to the policies and standards that drive and scale change. CDS' primary mandate is to focus first and foremost on delivery: helping CPS departments and agencies improve how they design and deliver services to Canadians. It does so by providing hands-on-help and expertise grounded in delivery experience, and fulfills its mandate through three roles: Deliver solutions CDS partners with Federal departments to design, prototype, and build better digital services, focusing on solving problems using design, agile methods, and proven technologies that put the user at the centre of our work. CDS also aims to take successful digital solutions and help replicate them across government. CDS also researches, develops and offers digital tools and technology applicable CPS-wide. Build capacity CDS invests in recruitment, participates in communities of practice and coaches departmental partners on the adoption of modern methods and technologies, to help public servants amplify their skills in areas like design, research, and engineering. OG. Platform
Provide advice Through its partnerships, CDS provides advice to the CPS grounded in practical delivery experience and global best practices. What is Platform? The experience of using many public services could be significantly improved, especially online. People who use public services want the experience to be good and to be consistent from one service to the next. The public's experience can be considerably improved by using some simple techniques and technology. More often than not, the technology needed to run services online is the same from one department to the next. As one government, we can create and maintain a common core infrastructure of shared digital standards, processes and components for departments to set up and on which to run their services. That way, departments can focus their efforts on the details that are unique to their services and helping people access what they need to get on with their lives. This is what is meant by a Platform for Government - often referred to internationally as Government as a Platform (GaaP). The parts that make up the platform can come from several sources. Thanks to shared standards, open source code, application programming interfaces (APIs) and human-centred design practices, platform products can be used by the federal government, other government jurisdictions or the private sector for use by government public services. Some platform products will be simple steps in a service journey; other platform products will enable whole services. For example, if one department created an application form that is easy to complete with all the right information on the first try, that form pattern could then be made available to other departments to use for different programs. If there is a software application for making and managing payments that has been designed and tested to give a choice of ways to pay for a government service, it could be easily integrated through the use of an API into tens or hundreds of service journeys. One department creates a component for gathering user feedback at the end of a transaction, and then all the rest can add it to their services. By making or procuring application infrastructure once and allowing all departments to use it, all parties can save time and money. But more importantly, it will give the public a simple, consistent and satisfying experience of interacting with the government from one service to the next. The Canadian Digital Service selected Notify as the first platform contribution. Within the overall Platform context, Notify is the first modest step in the longer term Platform strategy and is built on the concept that every government service should give its users the choice to receive a notification when they transact with that service, like confirmations of receipt or status updates. Government departments do not need to spend the effort and money on custom solutions for each service; Notify can be made once and can operate for all, for just a few thousand dollars each month, creating a positive impact on people's satisfaction and trust in government services and reducing significant duplication and cost of providing such services. CDS is authorized to provide Notify and other government-wide service components according to Section 7 of the Financial Administration Act. The platform will start with a few components doing basic but substantive things such as Notify. Subsequently, the standards, policies and market-forces will make it much easier to create a net new service or migrate a service away from legacy technology. In the near future, fitting everything together necessary to support a service online from the web domain to the hosting should take a fraction of the effort and cost that the orthodox wisdom suggests it currently requires. That will be better for the public, and it will be better for the government. OG. Platform
Itis within this context, the Executive Director, Platform, discharges the following accountabilities. Strategic Leadership The Executive Director has significant latitude for leadership within general guidance from the CEO/CDS. As the senior executive within CDS responsible for Platform strategic direction and enabling solutions, the ED is a key stakeholder in supporting the Chief Executive Officer in discharging CDS responsibilities for Platform and is vested with the authority to exercise overall strategic direction, leading the establishment of the end state vision, short-medium-to-long term strategy and a high level incremental roadmap for Platform evolution GC-wide, beginning with a high level outline of the thinking, activity and intent of the Platform, including the integrated business plan and integrated strategic objectives, desired benefits, goals and outcomes, the enabling business architecture, investment strategies and plans including related enabling documents such as Treasury Board Submissions (TBSubs) as required. The ED leads strategic Platform planning and solutions understanding the business owner and end user perspective, identifying the key elements of each within the context of the overall Platform vision, assessing their enterprise-wide implications and guiding the analysis, development and open sharing of ideas to realize the overall Platform solution vision and desired business outcomes. Driving Multiple Change Forward While the ED must lead the development of the overall Platform strategy, including centering on considering other platform contributions such as digital identity, user accounts, payments in and out, information publishing, and case management systems - all areas with known needs and a number of implementation avenues for exploration. For example, the ED has already led Platform teams in looking most concertedly into creating service appointments, making and managing forms, and testing online services to ensure they are accessible. Guidance and Governance The Government of Canada has the beginnings of the standards, processes and products needed to make a Platform for Government possible and sustainable. The ED s strategy must include iterating on these and demonstrating how to bring them together to deliver better outcomes from public services across the board: without suggesting that CDS be the sole Platform provider. As leader of the overall Platform management strategy driving change forward to achieve the best business outcomes, the Executive Director oversees the definition, design, implementation and management of integrated governance and oversight mechanisms inclusive of departments and agencies, other central stakeholders and Platform partners. The incumbent also advises departments and agencies and provides web-based performance information on key elements of the various projects under the incumbent's purview. Further, the ED establishes and manages the governance and oversight mechanisms required to represent the Chief Executive Officer as the senior CDS Platform representative to the service owners and acts to enable solutions, including for investment decisions; representing CDS in governance structures established by other government departments, agencies and territorial governments; developing budget proposals and managing the submission process for Platform investments; developing a performance management regime including determining service- related performance objectives for Platform and enabling solutions, and monitoring and reporting department, agency and service provider performance against such service measures. OG. Platform
The Executive Director develops and issues guidelines for funding, analyzes investment proposals, makes recommendations and interacts with departments and other TBS sectors relating to proposals, funding allocations, accounting for funds and results. Further, the incumbent also establishes desired business outcomes and performance requirements for these enterprise- wide projects on behalf of the CEO CDS and TBS, and ensures the capture and reporting of relevant performance metrics to determine progress against defined policy outcomes and performance measures. Change Management Given that incremental Platform development and implementation solutions could ultimately involve a fundamental change in the way work functions in the GC, coherent and consistent messaging coupled with utilization of consultative fora and feedback mechanisms will be involved in setting strategic direction and making it understood. This requires that the Executive Director play a high-profile spokesperson role at senior levels and is attuned to questions on future implementation issues or parallel initiatives which may complicate or compete with the existing Platform vision, strategies and plans. The ED must be tactful in setting collaboration initiatives. The incumbent maintains positive relations, and gains the confidence and credibility of all partners and stakeholders through outreach and engagement and use of persuasive marketing techniques, to win acceptance and support for the vision and strategic direction. The Executive Director also works closely with the Directors of Partnerships and Communities to define the requirements for and support service providers in the development and implementation of GC- wide change management strategies, to support departments and agencies as they undertake transformational, cultural challenges related to the implementation of the Platform approach, including strongly encouraging openess and sharing best practices, Relational/Storytelling/Advocacy/Challenge Role The Government of Canada has access to the technology and the talent, with the will and the demand in place to make a Platform happen. It doesn t take a lot of administration, money or time. But it does need effort, and it needs to be sustained over time. The experience of other countries who are further along on this journey shows that a Platform for Government starts small and builds and improves incrementally. The ED Platform plays a very strong relational role in realizing the above statement. First, the ED, working in alliance with the Director, Partnerships, the Director, Communities, the Director, Engagement and TBS Strategic Planning and Communications, ensures the development of an approved communications and publications plan relating to Platform strategic direction and incremental evolution, including web site content, senior level messaging and announcements. The incumbent must must build trust amongst business owners for the Platform concept, as demonstrated by the development of Notify. It will also be critical to select a nucleus of partners at the outset who have a keen interest in the idea and are prepared to support the collaborative effort required and inform new potential partners by disseminating information about Platform. In working with service owner senior executives, the ED must act as the senior representative, gaining high visibility and describing Platform success in other countries, including the speed and quality of results and long-term savings and demonstrating the major gains for a small investment dollar and participation in the collective effort will return significant dividends. As do the CEO, the Executive Director Communities and the COO, the ED must act as a positive advocating and educational force for Platform, promoting the regular and open exchange of information and ideas. At the same time the ED is expected to challenge current thinking, ensuring that the Platform vision and the current Notify product are sustained and that initial doubts or entrenched practices are overcome. In this respect, it is critical that the ED challenges those OG. Platform
doubts and embedded practices and, further, ensures potential service partners that the GC, not just CDS, is fully onside and supportive of the overall Platform strategy. The ED briefs senior government officials (up to, and including deputy ministers). These and other briefings may form part of CDS Communication, Outreach and Liaison function. The ED, as are the CEO, Executive Director Communities and COO, is called upon to be a strong advocate in interactions with senior stakeholders and clients within and outside the GC. In the long run, the Canadian Digital Service cannot be the sole platform provider for GC services. Instead, it specialises in products that help the public with common, direct interactions with government services. In doing so, CDS, through the ED, will encourage service teams in other departments to make their enabling products and processes open and available for others to reuse. For example, as CDS experiments further and starts to release and operate platform components, it will share code, an agile way of working, and an emphasis on results. CDS will prioritise working with federal government services, but will also readily engage with other jurisdictions and industries. Creating Synergies As a small organization, CDS is especially aware of the need to use its limited financial and human resources to their full potential. As the senior executive lead, the ED must develop and maximize the broader horizontal relationships between teams, between the specialist communities that comprise them, and between the business owners. Further, the ED must work to ensure that client executive leadership is also working towards creating synergies between its specialist staff and those of CDS and will intervene when those synergies are not being successfully created as the Platform work moves forward. Key Outcome The ED's key mission outcome is the development of a robust evolution to Platform, selling the concept incrementally across the system and gaining the trust, confidence, enthusiasm and contribution of partners with CDS and each other to continue to grow Platform. Key Risks and Challenges e The Executive Director will be required to employ a high degree of strategic planning and programme management expertise to develop, maintain and manage the people management services and solution vision, roadmap, high-level business architecture and associated strategies and plans. This role presents significant logistics, risk management and negotiations challenges in managing, coordinating and sequencing strategic enterprise-wide change in concert with different players and stakeholders, to maintain direction, engagement and momentum; overcome challenges; maximize opportunities, and accommodate stakeholders needs, policy interests, technology limitations, funding constraints and time pressures while ensuring that TBS proactively responds to its ever evolving business environment. The ED/S must be very adroit at advocating for changes to current practices. The ED, Platform in concert with the COO and the CEO must assess and balance many criteria, in order to set priorities, and will be challenged by many factors when advising the CEO on CDS current and future financial and human resource capacity available or to be acquired to accurately resource priorities and to accurately assess their feasibility to be undertaken in the near and long- term.

NATURE AND SCOPE Treasury Board is a unique Cabinet Committee whose powers derive from the Financial Administration Act that provides the framework for government management and which is responsible for accountability and ethics, financial, personnel and administrative management, comptrollership, approving regulations and most Orders-in-Council. The President of the Treasury Board chairs the Treasury Board. The President carries out their responsibility for the management of the government by translating the policies and programs approved by Cabinet into operational reality and by providing departments with the resources and the administrative environment they need to do their work. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) is the administrative arm of the Treasury Board. TBS is dedicated to ensuring the effective and prudent management of the Government of Canada s human, financial, information and technology resources in a manner that best supports the government's objectives and priorities. As the administrative arm of the Treasury Board, the Secretariat has a dual mandate: to support the Treasury Board as a committee of Ministers, and to fulfill the statutory responsibilities of a central government agency. The Secretariat recommends and provides advice to the Treasury Board on policies, directives, regulations, and program expenditure proposals with respect to the management of the government's total resources. Its responsibilities for the general management of the government affect initiatives, issues and activities that cut across all policy and program sectors subject to the Financial Administration Act. The Canadian Digital Service has been created as a standalone organization (sector) at TBS to support the Government of Canada (GC) in its commitment to provide the highest quality services, to meet the expectations of millions of Canadian citizens and thousands of Canadian businesses in the digital age. CDS is housed within TBS in order to benefit from line of sight across government and close proximity to the policies and standards that can help drive and scale change. CDS s primary mandate is delivery: helping CPA departments and agencies improve how they design and deliver services to Canadians. It does so by providing hands-on- help and expertise grounded in delivery experience in Canada and abroad, and it amplifies the impact of its delivery work and expertise by also building capacity in departments to work the same way and by providing advice on better service delivery. Accordingly, CDS has a three-part mandate: Deliver solutions CDS partners with federal departments to design, prototype, and build better digital services, focusing on solving problems using design, agile methods, and proven technologies that put the user at the centre of their work. CDS also aims to take successful digital solutions, its own and those of others, and help replicate them across government. CDS also researches, develops, and offers digital tools and technology applicable CPA-wide. Build capacity CDS invests in recruitment, participates in communities of practice, and coaches departmental partners on the adoption of modern methods and technologies, to help public servants amplify OG. Chief Operating Officer
their skills in areas like design research, design, and engineering and to drive the adoption of modern digital methods in departmental practice and culture. Provide advice CDS provides advice to the CPS grounded in practical delivery experience and global best practices. Within this context, the Chief Operating Officer, discharges the following accountabilities. CORPORATE ENABLER AND CHANGE MAKER The COO acts as the CDS corporate enabler, leading the teams charged with ensuring that the rest of the organization has what it needs to perform at an optimal level. Within this context, the COO is accountable for corporate (operational and administrative) services to this organization with offices in Ottawa and other cities: ensuring the development and implementation of policies; the ongoing management of executive, finance, administrative, and HR management processes; facilities oversight; procurement; accommodation; and security. The COO ensures such services are provided and continuously improved without unduly burdening or reducing the flexibility and velocity of the organization. As such, the COO plays a fundamental role in enabling the whole organization to succeed. This means ensuring people have the right tools, work environment, and, especially, the freedom and support to perform their best work and to challenge the status quo in government. This includes creating a digital toolset (hardware and software) that resembles the one private sector recruits would have used in previous jobs, so that they can continue to be as productive and effective in government. The COO must work and negotiate with counterparts across the Secretariat to remove barriers to CDS operations and to secure, protect, institutionalize (regularize), and expand where required on the flexibilities and authorities CDS has in place in order to work differently. The COO is also a change maker, driving changes across the CPA to scale the practice of modern digital delivery, by enabling other departments to adopt the same methods and tools used by CDS. This includes providing tools, guidance, and resources; hacking bureaucracy and scaling workarounds and solutions; driving changes to rules, standards, and directives; and improving and modelling processes. The COO is instrumental in identifying opportunities for business improvement and putting the user at the centre of all business decisions internally to CDS, as well as in the wider government context. TALENT MANAGEMENT The COO is the strategic lead for the CDS Talent Management function. As a very unique organisation, focused on building capacity, delivering solutions, and providing advice enterprise- wide, CDS is organizationally porous to the outside world and organizationally fluid within, in contrast to the vast majority of government departments which hire into and work almost exclusively with career public servants, who work within a well defined organizational hierarchy and become experts over a long period of time in supporting, or developing and delivering, specific programs and services to and for Canadians. Like all organizations, CDS has limited financial resources. Given its lean nature and ambitious multi-part mandate, it must carefully choose the projects and initiatives with which it gets involved. Project priority setting is complex and can shift, given that CDS work proceeds deliberately in phases with off ramp points and that the business owner has the ultimate authority over the project, although CDS s demonstrated expertise and proximity to the centre does give CDS moderate influential power. The above factors require careful strategic TM to ensure the right mix of high-capability team oriented talent is in the organisation with the right balance of skills, expertise, and experience drawing from both the private and public sectors, in Canada and abroad, technically-proficient digital professionals and bureaucracy savvy employees , to bring their strengths together to OG. Chief Operating Officer
fulfill the CDS mandate within its budget limitations. To make things work, the COO must have the talent/project strategic vision, an understanding of the Canadian digital labour landscape, and a CDS and enterprise-wide perspective, based on careful analysis of such factors as individual project requirements, talent availability and gaps, the client s capacity and willingness to invest human and financial resources in change; and CDS's capacity to re-assign talent quickly when new priorities arise or the individual s contribution to a particular phase of a project is complete. In effect, the COO plays a critical role in ensuring there are enough people for the work (the right people) and enough work (the right work) for the people. The scope of TM at CDS runs both broad and deep. It begins at the identification of needs; continues through sourcing and recruitment, assessment, negotiation, and staffing; carries further still into pre-onboarding, onboarding, the employee experience (work environment, tools, culture, management quality, etc.), and retention; and goes even to departure (e.g., exit interviews) and the health of the CDS community of alumni who serve as informal ambassadors for the organization. Each part of this lifecycle is managed deliberately and continuously improved based on measurement and feedback. Further, CDS is not an organization in which the expectation is that employees will stay indefinitely; employees join CDS on a tour of service . This organizational talent renewal is critical to remaining contemporary with newly emerging service design methods and technology and the ways they can be employed. As with many other aspects of CDS operations, the impact of CDS s TM reaches beyond the organization's boundaries, across the Public Service: through working in the open, the sharing of resources, the changing of rules and practices, and the cultivation of departmental counterparts teams to CDS's in the course of partnerships, CDS seeks to scale its TM practices across government. As the CEO's 2ic and Talent Management planning leader, the COO acts as a personal resource for the CEO on the organisation's TM Strategy. POLICY AND PLANNING First, CDS acts as a strong policy influencer both within TBS, working with other functional heads (e.g. OCHRO, OCIO, OCG and EMS), and with client departments, in the context of CDS's aim to increasing the CPA s capacity to deliver modern digital services. CDS uses its delivery experience with departmental partners to inform policy- and standard-setting by TBS policy centres and to support the challenge functions carried out across the Secretariat, including in the program sector and in OCIO. The COO plays a leadership, enabling, and advocacy role where CDS pushes for changes in policy, guidance, or communications from the centre of government in order to make it possible or easier for departments across the Public Service to adopt the same modern methods and practices found at CDS and in the private sector and leading countries. In concert with partners at TBS and CPA-wide, the COO acts as a catalyst and challenge function for policy reviews and makes recommendations at the highest levels, accordingly often interacting with deputy heads and ADMs of client organizations and working horizontally with senior staff and advising the CEO and Secretary accordingly. Secondly, the COO leads the provision of the full range of policy and strategic planning services to CDS. These accountabilities include CDS leadership for anything Cabinet or Treasury Board related (e.g. preparation of Memoranda to Cabinet (MCs), TB Submissions (TBSubs)), as well as for all CDS funding requests and matters, including both Budget and internal (e.g., reserve) asks. Further, the COO is accountable for all business plans and budget forecast reports: corporate reporting; expert input into all CDS/TBS planning initiatives/documents (e.g. strategic plans, Departmental Results Report (DRR) and the Departmental Performance Report) and is the CDS corporate link for these activities. OG. Chief Operating Officer
PROCUREMENT The COO works closely with TBS, other federal and outside partners in order to enable departments and agencies to adopt modern software-, technology-, and service-related procurement practices that are more modular and agile-compatible. An important aspect of the role is enabling small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) to have an opportunity to apply and contribute to federal service improvement and technology projects, where complexity, scale, and other factors have traditionally been barriers. In order to foster this, the COO oversees the Accelerator, a CDS business line that brings together service ideas, partner departments, and private companies (including SMEs) through incremental investment and service design process. The COO has broader responsibility for procurement enablement at CDS, including developing tools and resources from procurement templates compatible with modern service design methodology to qualified vendor pools designed to underpin the Accelerator, other procurement-for-delivery at CDS, and similar needs across government. The COO s procurement responsibilities also include overseeing the research and fulfillment of the team's needs for software and hardware to support their product and other delivery work, particularly in a distributed organizational context. As part of their change mandate, the COO also works to scale CDS solutions around modern tools to other parts of government through working in the open and clarifications or changes to rules, policy, and guidance. ADVOCACY Within the context of CDS s mandate, there is a regular requirement to brief senior government officials (up to and including the minister). These and other briefings form a significant component of CDS's core accountabilities, change advocacy, advice mandate, and charge to work in the open .. The COO s role in this respect, as the 2ic to the CEO, is to support and share this accountability with the CEO and other senior managers. The incumbent is called upon to be a strong advocate in interactions with ministers, deputies, and other senior stakeholders and interested parties within and outside the CPA, including provincial and territorial governments, other countries, universities and colleges, national and international standards bodies, CEOs and other senior officials of industry, leaders in the IT field, and the heads of national and international business associations. Like the CEO, the COO, while acting as a positive advocating force and exchanging information and ideas, is expected to challenge conventional thinking in order to advance the change that is at the core of CDS s mandate. ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY AND DIRECTION-SETTING As 2ic to the CEO and a member of the CDS senior management team, the COO is responsible for establishing and communicating organizational direction, ensuring that the organizational structure aligns with the organization s objectives and strategic goals, setting annual and quarterly priorities, and securing and allocating financial and human resources. A key aspect of the CEO s role is involvement in selection of work for CDS, that is to say, determining what partnerships and specific delivery projects CDS takes on, and what priorities are set for the Accelerator and other business lines and initiatives. The COO is also involved in problem-solving as needed with partner organizations, helping to resolve challenges or disputes as they arise. ENVIRONMENT AND CHALLENGES e The COO's policy mandate includes identifying and influencing policy and practice change requirements and their priority. The COO must be very adroit in advocating for these changes and will be challenged by many factors in determining their priority and, in concert with others, advising the CEO accordingly. These factors include: criticality of change; ease of change; ripple effects on other policies; appetite for change; timing of change and the inherent risk of change. OG. Chief Operating Officer
e Canadian Digital Services has limited financial and human resources. When advising the CEO on priorities, whether for the above or other projects and initiatives in which CDS is considering engaging, the COO will be challenged to accurately resource CDS according to Priorities and to accurately assess the feasibility of CDS undertakings against resource availability in the near and long-term. e The rapid growth of CDS, its tour-of-service employment model, and its distributed nature, put significant pressure on TM, employee enablement, and corporate services, creating a significant challenge for the incumbent. So too does the diverse employment base of the organization, drawing on the private sector and other countries and thereby requiring deliberate, continuous effort to orient new employees to the federal Public Service balancing the need for familiarity with its core tenets (e.g., values and ethics, official languages and accessibility requirements) with an understanding of the key dynamics that impact delivery (e.g., resistance to change) and how to navigate bureaucratic obstacles.

NATURE AND SCOPE I December 2OIO
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada HRSDC s mission is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and to improve Canadians quality of life. As such, the Department is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission, notably with an eye to building a twenty-first century economy for Canada and to strengthen the social foundations of the country. HRSDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for Federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities as related to the development of human capital; to promote an efficient labour market in part through Federal-Provincial/Territorial labour market frameworks; leading and reinforcing the development of workplace skills, including strong linkages and partnerships with employers; enhancing access to post-secondary education and lifelong learning; delivering government | services and income benefits; and regulating and promoting fairness and health and safety in Canadian workplaces. HRSDC supports Canadians and their communities by providing citizen-centred, quality service through a network of people partnerships and technology. This initiative helps Canadians access the full range of Government services and benefits by providing seamless, comprehensive one-stop service to more Canadians in more communities, and delivering it in a way that ensures a positive service experience for Canadians. The delivery of government services and programs is complex because of the broad scope of the programming involved, the number and diversity of the clients served and their needs, and the multiplicity of stakeholders and partners involved. The Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) provides the technological infrastructure to connect employees with each other, their clients and partners in order to deliver eighty billion dollars in benefits and respond to fifty million inquiries on an annual basis. The Branch supports business applications, access to data and the processing of benefit-related transactions. The provision and management of telephony and data networks, applications and data stores, Internet-based interfaces and new processes and technologies enable clients to engage with the HRSDC / SCI in new and more integrated ways and thus provide for greater service delivery efficiency. It is in this context that the Director General, Strategy and Architecture is accountable for orchestrating the planning, designing and implementing of an enterprise architecture program for HRSDC utilizing existing expertise and the traditional focus on technology systems to encompass the strategic business processes and information needed to achieve policy outcomes, demonstrate accountability and provide citizen and client- focused service delivery. The enterprise architecture must become embedded in new project and program design, outlining how programs and services are defined in order to create opportunities to capture savings due to re-use of common processes, data and systems. The creation of the enterprise architecture will transform the way that HRSDC conducts business at all levels. Enterprise Architecture structures describe the vision of enterprise-wide business, from the broadest conceptual elements down to the most detailed technical elements, and provide the framework for defining how major government Service/IM/IT projects align with this outcome-centred, strategic view of government business. The DG is accountable for the coordinated development of architectures for the business, information, solution (application), and technology needs and has lead responsibility for defining the enterprise requirements across all aspects of departmental business and business systems. Once defined, the incumbent ensures that these models, standards and protocols are used to ensure a consistent language for describing and classifying all facets of department operations and services. The incumbent articulates the vision for how these elements fit together and identifies opportunities for common or shared business processes and applications, in support of the rationalization of HRSDC operations and achievement of enterprise-wide efficiencies and cost reductions. The Director General develops and implements an enterprise architecture framework for the department that clearly outlines short, medium and long term goals. The incumbent provides support in collaboration with other DGs in the design, development, and implementation of information management/information technology services to support HRSDC, as well as other client federal government departments and agencies, with a focus on productivity, quality and service enhancements. The DG faces conceptual and managerial challenges in 2 December 2OIO
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada guiding horizontal IT enterprise architecture development for the IT community in HRSDC; strategies and frameworks and the development, implementation of governance mechanisms to monitor service quality and program success of modernized service delivery models. One of the major challenges is building a management structure that combines the many different spheres of activities, varied technology, user needs, existing systems, proposals, human resources and technical capacities and cultures; widely varying size and type of organization, and diverse management styles of the clients in the department into a cohesive plan that responds to the overall departmental IT and Shared Services agenda. One of the IT priorities for which the incumbent is responsible is providing leadership across the department in establishing the necessary linkages to support the development of technological tools that ensure effective communications and sharing of information and expertise, as well as the development of appropriate data and information management system links dedicated to influencing a strategic and cohesive approach to improving the access and delivery of and ongoing transfer of knowledge from and to key partners and the broader GOC community in a multi-stakeholder and multi-jurisdictional arena. The incumbent leads a strategic and cohesive approach for the development of new and or enhancements to existing business models for enterprise technology and applications in a multi-stakeholder and multi-jurisdictional arena, as well as generating a combination of results that are measurable in the short to medium terms and sustainable over the long term. The framework influences the multi-million dollar spending on IT technology and must be responsive to the various positions and program responsibilities of the stakeholders while advancing the long term IT agenda for HRSDC. The Director General is accountable for the development, design, implementation, evaluation and enhancement of the information management framework and policies which guide and standardize IM services, and must ensure that the framework adds value and remains relevant to the business agendas of the department and its clients. One of the major challenges presented by an integrated approach is that the framework will continue to evolve, driven by new ideas, tools, and business pressures and directions. The DG is accountable for IM strategies which create a foundation for managing information assets and information sharing, increase access to information, support evidence-based decision-making, and enables the transformation of business data into knowledge. It demands a broad horizontal perspective on the entire operating environment, internal and external, including the trends and developments in new technologies, and the existing and anticipated needs of the corporate clients. This is an extremely complex undertaking, and one which requires highly developed technical expertise and innovative thinking, coupled with a strong business sense and a thorough understanding of e-government. In view of the changing business environment, the DG must be highly analytical and innovative in developing business cases and future-focused, evidence-based recommendations to the ClO and management committees, regarding major IM investment decisions. The DG also has a large influence on the operational policies, program delivery paradigms and operations of all other organizations within HRSDC, and for leveraging corporate memory and knowledge across the management structure of the Department. The incumbent provides authoritative guidance and advice to managers across the HRSDC on the implications of new, or revisions to existing, strategic policies and of the impact of strategic plans on their organizations and associated service delivery, and assists managers in achieving required revisions and reorientations within their own spheres of accountability and operations. This is also true for partners in other federal departments that need to realign their services to match new orientations and strategic directions set by the DG. The incumbent is responsible for the overall technical standards and direction, and quality/integrity verification and validation for major application projects delivered through the service portfolios and is called upon to act as an agent of change in introducing and championing the use of advanced tools, techniques, applications development methodologies and data management practices within the Department. The applications maintained are diverse in nature, scope and technology which poses a challenge for the Chief in providing these technical services to ensure that the focus is continually on the business needs of the client and that the technical expertise within the Branch is harnessed to address client needs and problems in a seamless, flexible and cost-effective manner. Additionally, these requirements must be balanced by commitments to existing technical infrastructure and 3 December 2OIO

The DG must establish and maintain an extensive contact network with colleagues at the management /executive level throughout government and the private sector in order to exchange information and opinions on the future of IM/IT and knowledge management in business and to keep apprised of opportunities, trends and developments impacting on its implementation. Such contacts allow HRSDC and the CIO to pool its expertise and better manage its IM /IT investments through the sharing of systems and information. The incumbent must consider these influences in developing policy, architectural, standards methodology and data management directions for HRSDC, thereby contributing to a national common infrastructure to serve Canadians. The Director General is a member of the IITB CIO Executive Committee. There is a need to take a corporate- wide horizontal view of issues to be addressed.

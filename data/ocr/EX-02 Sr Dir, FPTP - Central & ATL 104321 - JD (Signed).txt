NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. The Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD) develops social policies and designs programs to ensure that children, families, seniors, persons with disabilities, the homeless and those at risk of homelessness, communities and others who are facing social challenges have what they need to maintain their well-being and facilitate their participation in Canadian society. ISSD works to build the Canada-wide early learning and child care system, ensures that eligible Canadians are provided with retirement, survivor and disability benefits, supports the long-term financial security of persons with disabilities, implements accessibility legislation and invests in the capacity of organizations and the non-profit sector to reduce 2
barriers and promote access to opportunities for vulnerable populations. The major programs managed by the Branch are Early Learning and Child Care, Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care, the Old Age Security (OAS) program, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the Canada Pension Plan disability (CPPD) benefit and the Canada Disability Savings Program (CDSP). With the 2O2O Fall Economic Statement, the Government of Canada announced the creation of a new Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care (the Secretariat) to support the design and implementation of a Canada-wide system of ELCC. Situated within ESDC, the Secretariat negotiates and manages the federal bilateral ELCC_ agreements with provinces and territories; conducts ELCC data and research projects; and provides funding to further innovation and increase access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive ELCC programs and services in Canada. The Secretariat also provides secretariat support services to the National Advisory Council on ELCC, and the FPT Forum of Ministers Most Responsible for ELCC and its governance structure comprising a DM Senior Officials table and FPT Working Group. It also ensures close coordination with the ESDC Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Secretariat on inter-related areas of policy development. Within this context, the Senior Director, FPT Partnerships Central & Atlantic is accountable for leading the negotiations with the provinces and territories in its region to establish the terms and conditions of bilateral ELCC agreements, supporting the delivery of bilateral, trilateral (with Indigenous governing bodies and provinces/territories) and multilateral ELCC initiatives and the ongoing work of the provinces and territories and ELCC stakeholders in the region to further develop, and implement a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care System that increases access to high quality, affordable, flexible, and inclusive child care across the country. The role includes responsibility for managing and advising on bilateral relations with the provinces and territories and on the development of the early learning and child care system in each jurisdiction; directing and overseeing management of the bilateral ELCC agreements once implemented, including subsequent amendments negotiated to existing FPT agreements; directing and overseeing the allocation and reallocation of federal funding supporting the implementation of bilateral ELCC agreements and the monitoring of data and reporting obligations, as appropriate; and ensuring ongoing Secretariat support is provided for the provincial and territorial implementation committees. The incumbent also directs the preparation of ministerial/official briefings and annual reports on the progress of bilateral ELCC agreements, as well as the provision of advice for official announcements related to the bilateral ELCC agreements. Major challenges of the position include the strong leadership and communications skills required to manage and advise on the Secretariat's relations with the provinces and territories in the assigned region, as well as stakeholder groups engaged as part of the Implementation Committees, to build greater capacity in the system and create a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care System that increases access to high-quality, affordable, flexible, and inclusive child care that serves the needs of communities throughout the regions. Equally challenging is the role played in aligning the negotiating agenda to reflect the Government of Canada's overarching vision for a national ELCC system and to balance the competing demands of the various stakeholders who play a contributing role in the development of a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care System. In carrying out the responsibilities of the position, the Director establishes and maintains a wide network of senior-level contacts within ESDC, with federal partners, FPT counterparts, with the 3
various ELCC working groups and committees, with Indigenous communities and other stakeholders with whom the Secretariat regularly interacts with respect to its FPT partnerships.

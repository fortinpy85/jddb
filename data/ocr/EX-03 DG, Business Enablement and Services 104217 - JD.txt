NATURE AND SCOPE Treasury Board is a unique Cabinet Committee whose powers derive from the Financial Administration Act that provides the framework for government management and which is responsible for accountability and ethics, financial, personnel and administrative management, comptrollership, approving regulations and most Orders-in-Council. The President of the Treasury Board chairs the Treasury Board. The President carries out his responsibility for the management of the government by translating the policies and programs approved by Cabinet into operational reality and by providing departments with the resources and the administrative environment they need to do their work. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) is the administrative arm of the Treasury Board. TBS is dedicated to ensuring the effective and prudent management of the Government of Canada s human, financial, information and technology resources in a manner that best supports the government's objectives and priorities. As the administrative arm of the Treasury Board, the Secretariat has a dual mandate: to support the Treasury Board as a committee of Ministers, and to fulfill the statutory responsibilities of a central government agency. The Secretariat recommends and provides advice to the Treasury Board on policies, directives, regulations, and program expenditure proposals with respect to the management of the government's total resources. Its responsibilities for the general management of the government affect initiatives, issues and activities that cut across all policy and program sectors subject to the Financial Administration Act. The Canadian Digital Service has been created as an autonomous and neutral organization to support the Government of Canada (GC) in its commitment to provide the highest quality services, to meet the expectations of millions of Canadian citizens and thousands of Canadian OG.

3 businesses in the digital age. CDS is housed within the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), to benefit from line of sight across government and close proximity to the policies and standards that drive and scale change. CDS primary mandate is to focus first and foremost on delivery: helping CPS departments and agencies improve how they design and deliver services to Canadians. It does so by providing hands-on-help and expertise grounded in delivery experience, and fulfills its mandate through three roles: Deliver solutions CDS partners with Federal departments to design, prototype, and build better digital services, focusing on solving problems using design, agile methods, and proven technologies that put the user at the centre of our work. CDS also aims to take successful digital solutions and help replicate them across government. CDS also researches, develops and offers digital tools and technology applicable CPS-wide. Build capacity CDS invests in recruitment, participates in communities of practice and coaches departmental partners on the adoption of modern methods and technologies, to help public servants amplify their skills in areas like design research, design, and engineering. Provide advice Through its partnerships, CDS provides advice to the CPS grounded in practical delivery experience and global best practices. Within this context, the Executive Director, Service, discharges the following accountabilities. Strategic Product Leadership The ED/S is first accountable for strategic product leadership. In this respect the ED/S works closely with the CEO, COO and other professional and technical advisers to first determine product priority. This determination is based on a broad and complex range of factors, including, but not limited to answering the following questions: first, and above all, is there a significant, positive impact on end users; can it be kept as simple as possible: is there departmental senior executive interest and commitment to put people and money into change; will the complexity of the current departmental (and central agency) policies, embedded systems and practices that support the status quo be amenable to change, if required; scope of change: especially in building a successful reputation for CDS; is the project feasible from a CDS perspective of its limited financial (and currently available) human resources; can the product be scaled and replicated within the GC and can it be made available to others too: can the product be designed to work with legacy systems; are there alternatives to digital that will work as well in the circumstances? As the senior executive accountable for service and service delivery, the ED/S is faced with complex decision making at the beginning of, and throughout, each partnership. Once the priority is determined and assurances are made that the business owner is onside, the ED/S provides broad executive oversight to the product lifecycle: research, discovery, design, development, testing, delivering, possibly scaling and replicating it across the CPS and making the product available to other users. A similar process is used to develop products outside of a direct client partnership, A key element of the ED/S's role is to ensure that the end user remains the focus, that the business owner is involved in every step of the process, and that, following handover, the business owner is able to operate the product independently and build further capacity from it. Further, the ED/S can help guide partners in the direction of using research based decision making, in order to ensure that user needs remain a priority. The ED/S will be called upon to intervene in circumstances where there is a perceived difference between partner needs and end user needs. On occasion, the ED/S must seek the intervention of senior staff up to and including the Secretary and Deputies to support a better solution. OG. Business Enablement and Services
a4 Leadership: Creating Internal Synergies The Service Directorate is comprised of five teams (currently), each responsible for a given product or products. As noted earlier under the Organizational Structure section, each team is comprised of a mix of talent representing the specialist communities of practice essential to develop and deliver the product for clients. ED/S manages the Head of Product, Head of Design, Head of Design Research, Head of Development and Head of Security and Reliability, and Manager of Delivery. Also pivotal to the organization are Principal Engineers and Principal Designers who are key players in the most complex and challenging product assignments. Further, the business owner has its experts who play a critical role in product delivery. As a small organization, CDS is especially aware of the need to use its limited financial and human resources to their full potential. As the senior executive lead, the ED/S must develop and maximize the broader horizontal relationships between teams, between the specialist communities that comprise them, and between the Principals. Further, the ED/S must work to ensure that client executive leadership is also working towards creating synergies between its specialist staff and those of CDS and will intervene when those synergies are not being successfully created as the project moves forward. Relational/ Advocacy Role The ED/S plays a very strong relational role with multiple facets. First, the ED/S must build trust for the products to be delivered by CDS. In working with department senior executives, the ED/S must act as the senior service representative, gaining higher visibility trust by extolling past successes, including the speed and quality of results and long-term savings and demonstrating the investment dollar value gained through scaling up and replicating products and pointing out new opportunities. As do the CEO and the COO, while acting as a positive advocating force and exchanging information and ideas, the ED/S is expected to challenge current thinking, ensuring that the GC's digital vision and the end user remain at the forefront of technological development. The ED/S briefs senior government officials (up to, and including deputy ministers). These and other briefings may form part of the CDS Communication, Outreach and Liaison function. The ED/S, as are the COO and CEO, is called upon to be a strong advocate in interactions with senior stakeholders and clients within and outside the GC. Environment and Challenges e The ED/S must be very adroit at advocating for changes to current practices. The ED/S in concert with the COO and the CEO must assess and balance many criteria, in order to set priorities and will be challenged by many factors when advising the CEO on CDS current and future financial and human resource capacity available or to be acquired to accurately resource priorities and to accurately assess their feasibility to be undertaken in the near and long-term. e Rapid growth of CDS and the challenge of finding staff puts significant pressure on service and service delivery capacity, creating a significant challenge for the incumbent.

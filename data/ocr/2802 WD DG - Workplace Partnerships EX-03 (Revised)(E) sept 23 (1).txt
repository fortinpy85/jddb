NATURE AND SCOPE: The mission of Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive workforce, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development and delivery of policies and programs to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to enable Canadians to move through life s transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. Clients include individuals, businesses/employers, institutions and intermediaries, Provinces, Territories and other levels of government, including Aboriginal government. The new Skills and Employment Branch was created in April 2OO7 and is the result of a recent integration of the former Employment Programs Policy and Design Branch, the former Workplace Skills Branch, the National Office of Literacy and Learning and a team responsible for the Opportunities Fund and Labour Market Agreement for Persons with Disabilities. The Branch contributes to enhancing the competitiveness of Canadian workplaces and increasing the labour force participation of unemployed and vulnerable workers through human capital and skills development; insuring lost employment income; reducing barriers for people seeking to enter or re-enter the labour market as well as investing in, recognizing and using skills, in and for the workplace; and creating opportunities for Canadians through training and mobility. 3
In this operating context, the Director General, Workplace Partnerships plays a critical role in providing the knowledge base, program directions, and national mechanisms required to ensure that Canadians have the skills and knowledge required for the workplace. The work of the Directorate is closely aligned to, and supports policy development, and facilitates systemic improvement to the labour market and the relationship of education to the labour market. The Director General leads a range of inter-dependent analytical, research, consultative and partnership activities to promote knowledge and understanding of human resources and career development challenges facing the private, public and voluntary sectors and Canadians in the labour market. The incumbent leads the strategic development and management of human resources by industrial sectors and their organizations, and promotes national partnerships with industry, and provincial/territorial governments education systems, by the developing Sectoral Councils and similar public, private and voluntary partnership arrangements as mechanisms for the design and implementation of national HR strategies. The Director General leads national sectoral studies to provide information on the public and private sectors, their work activities and performance, knowledge and skill sets and other human resources development issues, and to identify current, medium and long term employment opportunities. These studies also identify current gaps in information on occupations and work performed in the various public and private sectors; and critical human resources and knowledge/skill gaps or workforce shortages requiring collaborative action between the department, other federal and provincial departments/ministries, affected industrial sectors and involved public and voluntary sector organizations. The knowledge gained through sector studies and national occupational and human resources research projects facilitates the establishment of Sector Councils and influences and enhances the reorientation and relevance of national education, learning and training systems, and the conduct of major apprenticeship and other interprovincial employment mobility and standardization undertakings. These research projects and studies are also key sources of data and information for national innovation initiatives. The Director General provides national oversight for the Sector Council Program. Sector Councils serve as a mechanism to develop and sustain interfaces between the private sector, the national education and learning system and involved voluntary sector organizations. The Program assists these organizations to develop collaborative relationships to ensure the effective linkage of provincial and territorial learning systems to the evolving skills and knowledge requirements of the workplace. The Program also provides support to HRSDC s array of employment/employability strategies, and creates the dynamics and linkages to best deal with the employment and job market requirements, challenges and opportunities provided by emerging industrial sectors, the expansion and redirection of the public sector and the increasing role of the voluntary sector as a partner in the provision of public services. The Director General directs a range of partnering activities and initiatives through Sector Councils, Council-like bodies, and federal-provincial/Interprovincial Partnerships. These are designed to engage the provinces/territories and all involved public, private, 4
labour, voluntary sector organizations and other parties in developing collaborative mechanisms and approaches to deal with HR, skills and their associated learning issues for the Canadian labour market. The incumbent brings a professional body of research and analysis to assist in the resolution of major human resources development issues in the various sectors of the economy, and also plays a direct role in bringing together key parties in the development of national solutions. The Director General develops strategies, and brokers the consultations and negotiations required to reach consensus on the appropriate vehicle to deal with the situation and then directs the provision of facilitation and support services to the new entity which includes business, financial and operational planning, consultation and business models, secretariat requirements, internal and external communications, promotion and marketing which are provided to assist the Council or other entity to achieve self-sufficiency. Once self- sufficient, the Director General reorients the Directorate s relationship with it and acts as its federal representative and approves the provision of services required for the operations of the Council or partnership that may exceed its service delivery capacity. The Director General provides oversight to national examinations and other apprenticeship and accreditation programs to standardize employment criteria and reduce barriers to employment opportunities for trade persons across Canada. The incumbent acts as a catalyst in assisting academic, provincial/territorial and other partners and stakeholders to promote apprenticeship programs in response to human resources development issues in specific sectors. The Red Seal Program includes planning and conducting national occupational analyses for selected trades in order to gather the intelligence and knowledge required to serve as the base to develop national skill, knowledge and examination standards and to formulate innovative approaches such as the measurement of prior learning and experience gained through employment and on-the-job training to determine its suitability for inclusion in an accreditation program. The occupational analyses are also of key importance to those sectors where appropriately skilled trades persons cannot be readily found which impacts on their productivity and economic performance and on lost employment opportunities for Canadians. The Director General is also responsible for overseeing innovation initiatives to address labour market situations. Two main initiatives include the Workplace Innovation Initiative and the Pan-Canadian Innovations Program. The Workplace Innovation Initiative is designed to encourage innovative human resource investments in Canada in order to stimulate private sector productivity and competitiveness. Projects are intended to be reproduceable and have long term impact. Factors such as the quality of the innovation, the proponent's contribution, the proponent s and others ability to utilize the results beyond the project, the proponent's ability to spread the learnings to others and the overall potential impact on the labour market will be factors in selecting the best projects. The Pan-Canadian Innovations Program is designed to partner primarily with provinces/territories on developing innovations in human resources using El Part II funds and addressing the major strategic human resource issues of the day on a collaborative basis with provinces/territories. 5
The Director General ensures the coherence and viability of the Directorate s strategic and business priorities and policy and program frameworks within HRSDC s vision, and the Minister's and DM s strategic socio-economic priorities and goals. In developing the Directorate s operational policy and national program delivery frameworks and machinery, the incumbent must take into account the emerging role of Service Canada and other elements of the government s evolving human resources development agenda. The Director General must also ensure that these frameworks fully reflect the sensitive and constantly evolving environment of Federal-Provincial/T erritorial partnerships and arrangements, and other domestic and international issues. The Director General leads the development of the Directorate s business plans and related performance measurement, accountability and reporting frameworks which reflect the priorities and interests of the Branch, HRSDC and external, horizontal initiatives and other central agency priorities. This ensures that the positions and expectations of key players are reflected in the Directorate s management processes and ensures that the monitoring and evaluation of policy and program delivery and the quality of the information reported to senior management, meet the highest standards. The incumbent provides a strong leadership role for the skills development/partnership portfolio within HRSDC and across the federal government. The Director General must secure effective partnerships and working relationships with the central agencies and OGDs concerning the portfolio to harmonize federal policy and program efforts, in a dynamic, high-profile environment. The incumbent acts as an advocate and brings strong negotiation and persuasive abilities and skills to bear on these parties to gain their acceptance of Branch/HRSDC priorities and to enlist their support in the implementation of initiatives or in the development of complementary policy and program approaches and activities. The Director General provides authoritative advice and briefings to ADMs, the DM and the Minister including providing input into the development of Memoranda to Cabinet and submissions to the central agencies and Cabinet concerning major program policy and delivery initiatives and strategies. As a key contributor to the development of micro- economic strategies falling within the mandate of the Directorate, the Director General develops HRSDC s programs and service delivery response to federal commitments. The Director General must apply a comprehensive understanding of the evolving positions and priorities of key external players including the central agencies and OGDs and a wide range of national private, public and voluntary sector organizations involved in, or affected by, the portfolio s policy and program mandate. The incumbent faces a large managerial challenge to effectively planand direct a large corporate Directorate which is responsible for the delivery of national programs of strategic importance to Canada s labour market and all related aspects of its human resources, with a specific emphasis on learning.

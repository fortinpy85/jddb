NATURE AND SCOPE Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) is responsible for providing Canadians with the necessary tools to thrive and prosper in the workplace and community. The Department supports human capital development and labour market development and is dedicated to establishing a culture of lifelong leaming for Canadians. Its clients include employees, employers, individuals receiving employment insurance benefits, students and those who need focused support to participate in the workforce. The Employment Program Policy and Design Branch provides a strong corporate capacity to respond to the emerging economic and labour market needs of Canada and Canadians. This is accomplished through the development and 2
implementation of partnership and renewal strategies and includes research, ongoing policy and legislative review, policy development and negotiated agreements with the provinces and territories. The Director General, Federal, Provincial, Territorial Partnerships is the departmental tead on the development and maintenance of a new labour market framework supported by a new set of bilateral Labour Market Partnership Agreements (LMPAs), resulting in a more integrated labour market system in Canada. This framework provides an umbrella for existing labour market development agreements (LMDAs) which are bilateral federal-provincial/territorial agreements, pursuant to Part fl of the Employment Insurance Act.

The Director General also oversees the planning and preparation for the three year review of the new labour market framework, including the development of recommendations to cabinet and their implementation as well as the development and implementation of the federal govemment's strategy for the renewal of the 5 year LMPAs.

NATURE AND SCOPE The Income Security and Social Development (ISSD) Branch is a focal point for social policy and programs designed to ensure that children, families, seniors, people with disabilities, homeless persons, communities and others who are facing social challenges have the support, knowledge, and information they need to maintain their well-being and facilitate their participation in society. ISSD is responsible for developing policies, and designing and delivering high-quality programs for seniors, children and families, persons with disabilities and communities, while having particular responsibilities for Canada s $52B public pension programs, including OAS and CPP. Together the OAS and CPP form the largest federal government program, involving 5 million beneficiaries and I5 million contributors. Close to 5O% of Canadian seniors rely on these pensions as their main source of income. These programs are multi-faceted and represent benefit packages including pension benefits, income tested top-up benefits and disability support benefits delivered in Canada and abroad. It is in this context that the Senior Director, through the Director General, Seniors Policy and Pensions Secretariat (SPPS), is responsible for developing a comprehensive agenda that combines all current and emerging OAS CPP program issues and provides advice and input to HRSDC Portfolio senior management on the impact of these issues. The main purpose of this Senior Director position has evolved into one of mediation between the two parts of the Department, to reconcile and take ultimate decisions on given policy implementation aspects, program design or redesign, governance Structures and mechanisms. The Senior Director is called upon to develop and recommend strategies, approaches and initiatives to balance the diverse and often disparate interests of a number of parties in achieving consensus on defining, developing and implementing solutions to often very different OAS CPP problems. In doing so, the Senior Director is responsible for creating an atmosphere that is non- adversarial and facilitates the identification of solutions, where there may be divergence of opinion and where considerable compromise may be necessary. The Senior Director hears out dissenting opinions, attempts to narrow divergence of views and, time being of essence, makes a final call or recommendation to senior management regarding service delivery issues between HRSDC and Service Canada. In the process, the Senior Director advises on current and emerging pension policy issues that impact both CPP and OAS both now and in the future. This requires developing well-balanced advice taking into consideration the many complicating factors such as the contribution of public pensions to the well-being of seniors and the need to update programs largely designed forty years ago to better meet current labour market demands. 3
The Senior Director provides strategic program delivery advice and recommendations regarding policies developed by colleagues and policy decisions made by senior management. This ultimately has substantial influence on the directions taken by the Department and by the federal government on OAS CPP issues related to the national programs. The Senior Director acquires and maintains knowledge of the government's objectives and policies on pension OAS CPP issues and the government's overall policy agenda. The Senior Director must also keep abreast of the implications resulting from the implementation of the seniors income security and social benefits by provinces and territories, the enforcement and interpretation of associated acts, regulations and procedures and emerging major files, such as disabilities, mental well-being, aging, health and life transitions. The Director oversees the development of a corporate knowledge base for the Department facilitates and sustains the flow of information among the provinces and territories, the Department and other federal departments. The incumbent must ensure that this knowledge base supports informed decision making for senior corporate and regional management, other federal departments and the provinces or territories related to HRSDC s vast relations network and activities. The Senior Director is the focal point for providing strategic advice in the resolution of legislative and policy issues and priorities that impact on the development of a cohesive and effective service delivery network. This requires the exercise of skill and leadership to manage the communication and implementation of legislative and policy issues which may impact on the delivery of pension benefits. The Senior Director is confronted with a series of difficult managerial challenges which include: the administrative expertise required to establish viable and effective programming interventions and assurance control mechanisms, the interpersonal skills to work constructively with a wide variety of stakeholders to achieve tangible results win a difficult and complex enterprise; the recruitment and retention of professional staff in such a varied business environment; and making decisions and taking action ina complex technical environment requiring continuous association and cooperation with a variety of stakeholders.

Service Canada helps Canadians access the full range of government services and benefits they want and need, by
& ding seamless, comprehensive one-stop service to more Canadians in more cOMimunities, delivered with the right service attitude. Over a three-year transition period, the new department will integrate federal services and benefits, thereiy improving Canadians ability to get the help they need in one place, whether by phone, Internet c: in person. Service Canada integrates services from a number of federal departments to form an easy-to- access network of multi-channel service delivery through a national network of call centres, mobile outreach, Internet-based services and traditional mail and paper channels. These services touch all aspects of the lives of Canadians: from parental and pension benefits, to matching employers with job seekers, applying for a passport and obtaining a Social Insurance Number. Today, this network brings together 32O points of service in communities throughout Canada; a national I-8OO-O-Canada telephone service providing Canadians with information about all federal government services; and a range of on-line services at servicecanada.gc.ca. in 2OO6, Service Canada's points of service will double, reaching I 25 million more Canadians and giving access to many remote and rural communities previously uncer-served. One of the primary ways this will be done is through mobile outreach - scheduled or in response to a particular need -- by knowledgeable Service Canada representatives traveling to meet the special needs of individuals, employers, and organizations. The new inodel of service delivery also includes the development of effective service and referral linkages to provincial, territorial and municipal governments. A critical feature of the Service Canada vision is the idea of managing the service strategy and the resulting integrated delivery network on an enterprise- wide basis, encompassing almost all interactions between the Government of Canada and citizens. The implementation of Service Canada is an ambitious and complex ide. taking which will require the planning and integration of numerous initiatives and operations rom several departments and multiple branches over the next three years in order to realize tne intended benefits. The Director of Ministeria! Communications Services position is a key player in promoting the evolving federal and Service Canada visions and policy agenda. It is in this context that the Director, Ministerial Communications Services is responsible for providing and coordinating all Communications services to the assigned Client and in changing traditional service delivery concepts and models. There is a need to provide advisory, capacity building and enabling services to the clients to assist them in the development of new information products and outreach approaches. In this way the Director has a strong impact on the success of the Client in reaching and communicating with its external clients, stakeholders and partners, including the general public and special target groups. The Director has a dual role. In the first instance, he/she is a member of the Marketing and Communications Branch's Management Team and its management Committee. In the second role, the incumbent is the expert Communications manager and service provider to the assigned Clients e.g. supporting the Minister and Deputy Minister s Office and its Director of Communications/Press Secretary etc. Through the first role, the Director makes a strong contribution to the corporate and national Communications vision, goals, objectives, priorities and strategic orientation of the Marketing and Communications Branch. He/She is also a key member In the development and maintenance of the Branch's national planning, policy, procedural and service/program delivery frameworks. As part of this corporate Marketing and Communications management cadre, he/she can be tasked with investigaling national issues
ns the Communications Program and its responsiveness to senior management of o mmce Canada as well as to the organization's external clients. This rvolves the chairing of Committees and the leadership of Project Teams often composed of communications experts, consultants and program managers. Similarly, the incumbent can be assigned to represent Service Canada on a central agency driven, or an interdepartmental Committee or Project Team, responsible for analyzing a federal government-wide Communications policy or program issue or developing a major Communications initiative. As part of the corporate Communications responsibilities, the Director nus: establish strong horizontal policy and service delivery linkages with his/her colleagues in the Branch s other Divisions. Regarding the corporate functional positions, (i.e., Strategic Communicat.ons, Corporate and Regional Communications and Ministerial Services), the Director mus! advocate the interests and priorities of his/her assigned Client to these officials to ensure they are adequately considered and reflected in actions and initiatives they wiil take or lead. Similarly, the Director must also act as the focal point to represent the priorities and corporate strategies and business orientations of the Marketing and Communications Branch with the client and his/her Management Team and organization. This ensures the optimal harmonization of the corporate Marketing anc Communications Branch and the Client's communications strategies, orientations, produ:cts, services and systems and maximizes resource effort while avoiding duplication and inconsistencies. The Director also deals with his/her colleagues in the other Communications Divisions to ensure opportunities for joint action or integrated messages are identified and acted upon. Through these contacts the incumbent also ensures consistency in service del.very and shares best practices and lessons learned. While this corporate role is of importance to Service Canada s national Communications program, the greatest percentage of time is spent on its second role and responsibilities; that is the Communications Manager and expert advisor to his/her assigned Client. Due to the management model utilized in the Marketing and Communications Branch, the Director has great autonomy and authority to provide services, products and activities to the client organization. It is expected he/she will do so in accordance with the corporate Communications vision, priorities and frameworks however; he/she has the latitude to adapt these to meet the Client s specific needs and to further its outreach to its external clients, stakeholders and partners. A major challenge for the Director is in turning around a communications program previously reactive and issues-driven. This requires him/her to reorient the perspectives, work habits and service delivery practices of the Division's staff so they focus on the conceptualization and delivery of proactive and innovative services, products and activities. This needs sensitive management and handling to gain their agreement and acceptance of the new priorities and approaches. It also requires providing training and development to staff members to assist them in adjusting to the new service delivery regime and its strategic and business orientations and directions. This is to facilitate the development of a better communications capacity within the Marketing
& Communications Branch to assist in implementing new Service Canada priorities (e.g., eianced outreach; greater access to Service Canada s services and knowledge/information bases through increased use of electronic and other leading-edge communications technologies, systems and products; citizen engagement, etc.). As such tne Director must develop and sustain an awareness of the importance of strong communications delivery and support within the management cadre of the assigned Client and must establish a level of confidence with them at the highest level. He/She sits as a member of their Committees and is the expert advisor and strategist for all policy and program initiatives and activities requiring communications support and/or products and services. In many cases the line managers do not fully realize the role communications can play to facilitate their activities outside of issues management and other traditional services (e.g., Ministerial Services, media relations, publications, events) which have always been a strong requirement for the program. The incumbent must continue to provide strong expertise and support in these areas while inculcating an acceptance of the value of new communications services (e.g., public opinion research, social marketing, service and product testing) he/she must also promote the essential need for the early involvement of the Communications Division in major policy and program launches and in conducting analyses and scans to determine the perspectives of the media and key client, stakeholder and partner publics for the Client. As well, the Director must advocate the ability of the Division to play a pivotal role in assisting Client realize their priorities. This is complicated by the fact that due to devolution, co- management and other alternative service mechanisms. This can require extensive negotiation on the content of releases and announcements and on promotional material to ensure optimum profile and recognition of Service Canada and federal involvement and expenditures A key function of the Director is to lead all communications planning for the Client and to develop and implement service contracts with them and their Management Committee. This requires driving a consensus among sectors that have different priorities, service celivery platforms and often different client, stakeholder and partner organizations. {tis imperative that the Director gets these senior Clients (e.g., DM, ADM, Associate ADM, DGs) to focus on the macro-communications priorities and activities in order to build the strategic and operational communications plans required for its major policy and/or program initiatives. As much as possible, the Director will act as a catalyst to promote and achieve the economies and enhanced effectiveness and profile that can be attained by integrated initiatives and messages. The Director provides directly, or coordinates the delivery through or with the corporate Communications functional groups and external companies, of all communications services, systems and products. This includes all traditional services (e.g., Ministerial and media relations, advertising, promotion, writing and editing, media analysis/monitoring, public enquiries, creative services, development and production of audio-visuals, publications, events/exhibits, etc.) as well as state-of-the-art services (e.g., Intra/Internet, public opinion research, social marketing, Web Sites, CD-ROMs, etc.). The incumbent also ensures the Client is provided with appropriate information technology to support the cost effective management of all communications activities and to establish appropriate information linkages with the Regions and other key external organizations. As the Client s key communications advisor and service provider, the Director leads all national communications activities and initiatives related to the Client's specific areas. When we consider the scope and size of Service Canada, the challenge of effectively implementing the
& red functional direction networks and frameworks is obviously large. In many cases the U ctor must assess, for the DM, ADM and senior management, the capacity of the Regional Communications organizations to deliver the required communications services or initiative given their resource allocations and the competing priorities they face at the Regional level. In many instances, he/she will, in fact, determine the strategic and business approach and will oversee the development of needed products and services and provide corporate direction and assistance to the regional staff to assist them in the rollout of this initiative If the project or initiative requires substantial resource effort or specialized expertise. the Director will participate in the hiring of required consulting capacity and skill sets. He/She monitors the roll-out of these initiatives and also evaluates their impact and effectiveness in reaching target and general audiences and publics and in promoting the federal, Service Canada and Client interests and involved policy or program initiatives or issue. Linked to the functional networks with the Regions both at the communications and program levels is the responsibility of the incumbent to assist the Client in best promoting its profile, activities and issues across Service Canada and with national and international publics. This internal communications function is an important aspect of Service Canada s vision as it relates to promoting an understanding among staff of the overall service delivery of the department and the need to integrate its programs to the greatest degree and to also support managers and staff in adjusting to new policy and program requirements. The Director will not only oversee Client specific internal communications announcements and activities but will contribute to the assigned client's perspective and priorities to Service Canada s integrated internal communications initiatives, activities and messaging. The incumbent provides the corporate leadership to the Client in developing, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of its strategic and business communications plans. The Director must ensure that a consistent, integrated approach to communications prevails and achieves this by developing service standards and performance indicators in consultation with communications specialists in PCO, the Marketing and Communications Branch, the Regions and with managers across the assigned program A major challenge is the provision of creative advertising, audio-visual and exnibit design/display services for the Client across Canada. This is a growing priority for the federal government which wants to ensure that the federal role, responsibilities and funding levels are understood and appreciated by Canadians who can often mistake federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictions, actions and contributions. The Director provides such services directly to the corporate offices of the Client and for national issues and campaigns, and coordinates regional service delivery through exercising authoritative fractional direction. These services are key to the successful communication of Service Canada and Branch policy and program initiatives and public education and social marketing messages and campaigns. The Director assists the DG in preparing for, or in sponsoring major presentations to the Service Canada Executive Committee. Similarly he/she will be involved extensively in initiatives and activities involving the DM's and the Minister's Offices, Cabinet, other Minister's Offices and Parliamentarians due to his/her awareness of the Client's positions on policy and program matters and the need to coordinate these within Service Canada and with other federal departments, other levels of government and key external stakeholders and partners. In these roles, the incumbent discharges considerable influence on the strategic priorities and direction that will guide the Client and govern its interaction with domestic and international
(C's. stakeholders and partners. The Director has frequent contact with officials of the central agencies (e g , PCO ard PMO), provincial/territorial departments, other federal departments (e.g.. Health Canada, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Industry Canada, Fisheries and Oceans and other economic and social agencies).

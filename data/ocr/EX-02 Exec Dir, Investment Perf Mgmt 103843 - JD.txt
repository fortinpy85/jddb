Nature and Scope Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the Department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. It is one of the largest and most complex federal departments. It employs over 24,OOO people and its activities account for almost one out of every three dollars spent by the federal government. The ESDC Portfolio (encompassing the Department, Labour Program and Service Canada) operates within a highly matrixed governance structure and operating model, supporting four Ministers (i.e. Minister of Families, Children and Social Development; Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour; Minister of Public Services, Procurement and Accessibility; and Minister of Seniors). ESDC has a broad mandate that includes social policies and programs, including Labour, and the delivery of a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives. For example, the Department provides seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education, and assists parents who are raising young children. The Labour Program contributes to social and economic well-being by fostering safe, healthy, fair and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the federal jurisdiction. Service Canada helps citizens access ESDC's programs, as well as other Government of Canada programs and services. Additionally, ESDC now has legislative authority to deliver services on behalf of other organizations and must therefore recover costs for these activities, which adds additional complexity to service delivery operations. ESDC reaches virtually every Canadian through over 58O of Service Canada s points of service across the country, by phone, in person, or on-line through the canada.ca website. Service Canada, which began operations in late 2OO5 with a mandate to provide Canadians with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits, accounts for the majority of operating results of the Department, employing approximately I7,OOO employees across Canada. Through Service Canada, the Department is responsible for delivering over $I2O Billion in 3
benefits directly to individuals and organizations through such Government of Canada programs and services, such as Employment Insurance, Old Age Security, the Canada Pension Plan, Passport Receiving Agent Services, the Social Insurance Number, and the Canada Student Loans Program. The Department also provides $4.8 Billion in funding to other levels of government, educators and organizations in the voluntary and private sectors. The Treasury Board has recently introduced new or changes to existing policies, including its new Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments which took effect on April I, 2OI9, dealing with investment planning, project and programme management. This policy has resulted in new and increased expectations on how departments set, oversee and deliver value from their investment programmes and projects, It seeks to ensure that the Government of Canada has the necessary assets and services in place to support program delivery to Canadians so that; assets and services are well managed; decisions are based on an assessment of full life-cycle costs and demonstrate value for money and sound stewardship; governance and oversight are effective; integrated and collaborative practices are in place; and the workforce has the requisite knowledge, experience and skills to implement the changes. The responsibility to implement this new policy lies with departmental designated senior officials who support the deputy head's accountability for implementing and ensuring all requirements are met under the policy. ESDC s CFO is the Senior Designated Official for the Management of Projects and Programmes, with delegated authority from the Deputy Head to: support and provide advice to the Deputy Heads; ensure that all relevant policies are in place and that key departmental stakeholders have been consulted in their development; and identify requirements and support development of the capacity, competency and knowledge of the Department's workforce in Project and Programme management. Also of importance to the context of this position is the new philosophy of Managing Successful Programmes (MSP). MSP codifies good practices in the successful delivery of transformational change, through the application of Programme Management. Its focus is on major transformational initiatives and complex projects with many interdependencies, risks, and conflicting priorities which need resolution. It outlines a system of decision making that allows for all of these factors to be balanced and dealt with, enabling transformation in line with long term goals to be achieved. Service Canada is currently undergoing significant change to its operations model (for example the Benefit Delivery Modernization Programme) which will benefit from the application of Programme Management. Within this environment, the Senior Director, Investment and Performance Management, establishes the Directorate as the Centre of Expertise in the Department for the development of the Department's three year integrated Investment Plan (which includes departmental plans in the areas of real property, IT infrastructure,) and its annual update. The Senior Director is also accountable for the development and implementation of the totally new methodology in the Department - Programme Management, which involves the planning and management of many highly complex major transformation projects required for the organization to deliver its mandate and meet the needs of Canadians in a more effective way. The Senior Director provides departmental leadership to the development of the Department's $5 Billion Investment Plan every three years to the Treasury Board Ministers and its annual update for submission to the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS). The Senior Director provides oversight to ensure that the Investment Plan is aligned with government and departmental priorities, and that proper benefit management, risk management, performance management and reporting, opportunities for innovation, and the whole-of-life cost of stewardship based on the life cycle of assets and services, are reflected in the Plan. The Senior Director leads assessments of the Department's Organizational Project Management Capacity Assessment, and Project Complexity and Risk Assessment, which identify the level of risk and complexity of all projects identified in the Department's Investment Plan. The Senior 4
Director establishes risk thresholds for acquired services and projects for inclusion in the Investment Plan and directs the development of the business case and rationale to obtain TB approval of the thresholds. The Senior Director also directs the regular review of threshold levels to ensure their continuing practicality and to obtain TBS approval. Given the large number of projects managed by the Department and the significant transformation exercises in effect or planned so the Department can discharge its mandate, establishing reasonable threshold levels is essential to the Investment Planning process. The Senior Director provides independent, strategic advice to the CFO and SDO, the CTO and Senior ADM (governance committee chairs) on risks, opportunities and impacts, the affordability of Investment proposals, the appropriateness of investments, the management of risks, the identification of benefits, and integrity of all financial information contained in the Department's Investment Plan and related TB Submissions, thus ensuring consistency in approach, management and results across the organization. The Senior Director is charged with safeguarding ESDC s reputation with Treasury Board by increasing the professionalism and consistency of the Department's investment plans. The Senior Director provides leadership to engagement and liaison with central agencies and represents the Department with TBS officials at the Assistant Secretary and DG level to defend, explain and promote the image of ESDC as an organization with a regimented and robust planning environment. The Senior Director is the recognized expert in the Department on the interpretation and application of central agency policy and guidelines in the fields of investment planning and programme management. The Senior Director directs the development and implementation of departmental policies, processes, guidelines and tools governing the work, including the planning framework and reporting tools to monitor and report on major investment programmes and individual investment projects. Additionally, the Senior Director provides leadership to the development of predictive plans and reports on all facets of investment management throughout the life cycle of projects, thus increasing value-added support to both the CFO and SDO, the CTO and Senior ADMs, as well as to programme and project managers. The Senior Director leads the development and implementation of the new Programme Management methodology for the Department. The Senior Director provides leadership to the development and evolution of the programme management framework and policies, and fundamental building blocks that are relied upon when developing major transformational projects, such as tools and guidelines that aid decision making, risk and benefit management protocols, and project and programme assurance, ensuring compliance with central agency and government of Canada requirements. The Senior Director builds capacity in the organization to help program heads craft objectives and develop plans that place programmes in a wider strategic context and ensure their alignment with departmental objectives. A fully mature IPM function transforms traditional investment planning, governance, programme management, the new risk and benefit management, and project & programme assurance and reporting into an integrated and aligned approach. All these functions must work together as an integrated whole. The Senior Director provides departmental leadership to effect this creation, evolution and transformation, which enhances executive management decision making and oversight of the Investment Portfolio through an end-to-end approach in all these areas. The Senior Director also represents ESDC with the Office of the Comptroller General (OCG) and chairs interdepartmental committees to export lessons learned and methodologies to drive adoption of this new methodology government-wide. As the departmental OPI for investment planning and programme management, and associated governance, the Senior Director directs environmental scans and leads consultations with other government departments to identify best practices for possible use by the Department in enhancing its governance processes, to ensure robust investment planning, and programme and project management decision making in the Department. The Senior Director directs monitoring of investment performance to assess achievement against plan, and the development of value- 5
added reports which provide the governance committee chairs with a complete view of the Department's programme and project environments, provide programme and project management teams with value-added predictive information to help them to be successful, and provide TBS with required compliance reports. The Senior Director is also the secretariat for key CFO and SDO, CTO, Senior ADM and DG led Departmental governance committees, including the Risk Review Board, MPIB and DGPOC, and accompanies the CFO and SDO, and DG to provide authoritative advice on the Portfolio of Major Projects and Programmes to the Deputy Minister on a monthly basis. The Senior Director provides leadership to project assurance and its evolution to programme assurance, to provide an independent assessment of programme and project delivery for the Department. The Senior Director provides leadership to analyses of business models for project and programme delivery to ensure their ongoing relevance and adherence to efficient processes and costing, user experience, and technical underpinnings, so projects and programmes are delivered in an efficient, cost effective and timely way. The Senior Director provides leadership to the development and delivery of risk and benefit management services for major projects, programmes and investments. Fundamental to both risk and benefits management is identifying risks and benefits through intelligence gathering and analytics, their monitoring throughout the project/programme life cycle until project/programme close out, and harvesting of benefits realization once the initiative is transferred to operations. The Senior Director provides leadership to independent reviews of risks and benefits, associated analyses and reporting to ensure accountability across the organization. To effect such major changes the Senior Director provides leadership to the development and delivery of training and awareness programmes to ESDC's senior officials (ADM and DG level) to increase understanding of new and changed approaches as a result of the implementation of programme management, and assist them in the development of their investment plans. There are several challenges for the position. First, ESDC is currently undergoing a rapid transformation. Many new projects are automating and streamlining services which grow ever more complex to meet the demands of government and Canadians. The increasing pace of change creates an environment of higher complexity, interdependencies and risk. This environment highlights the importance of key organization capabilities, including governance, planning, prioritization, risk & benefits management, programme management and resource management. These changes and the scale of the projects involved necessitate a new way of building projects & programmes and managing investments to adapt to new business models and drive innovative change across the Department. This represents a challenge for the position as the Senior Director must drive this change by establishing scalable and agile frameworks, policies and procedures that both adapt to and encourage new ways of doing business that will increase efficiency. The Senior Director must ensure that the IPM function is matured through a complex, integrated and aligned approach which involves building and integrating new capabilities and capacity Department-wide to drive change in both the Department and across government as a whole. ESDC's underlying policies are driven directly from Treasury Board guidelines and policy. Policy written at Treasury Board is, however, written with many diverse operations and departments in mind and as such is broad and flexible, allowing for considerable room to adapt the specifics in accordance with specific departmental needs. Tailoring these policies represents a significant challenge for the position as the policies must not only serve ESDC s interests but adhere to Treasury Board's overall directives. The Senior Director must develop policies that are adaptable to changes in legislation, policies and expectations from TBS. The Senior Director also influences TBS on the development of overarching central agency policy to enable ESDC to provide efficient, and highly valuable services to Canadians while driving change and evolving as circumstances evolve. 6
The significant changes in policies, procedures and methods of operation that are necessitated by modern service delivery are divergent from the ways of the past. Increasing expectations by clients for better services in a timely, accessible and accurate manner pose a challenge for the position. Canadians expect integrated delivery of social programs and services. Hence, client management is highly important in order to maximize the uptake of new methodologies and ways of doing business and enable the designed efficiency and service gains to be realized. This represents a challenge for the position as departmental managers are accustomed to conducting their affairs in the well- established, legacy fashion and as such need to be on-boarded and equipped with the skills necessary to deploy the new methodologies in their operations. The Senior Director also must possess a considerable amount of flexibility and adaptability to proactively respond and adapt frameworks and methodologies to changes in expectations from stakeholders, and senior executives as needed. External to the Department, the Senior Director chairs the Interdepartmental Investment Planning and Project Management Community of Practice (IPPM CoP); represents the IPPM CoP on the Senior Designated Official Council, and the TBS Advisory Committee on Project Management & Investment Planning; and is the organizer of Professional Development Days for the IPPM CoP in collaboration with the CSPS and CRA. Within ESDC, the Senior Director meets with the four DMs and ADMs of the Department on a monthly basis, in conjunction with the CFO and CTO, and DG, to advise on the status of investment projects and options to address issues; and is a co-presenter at the Portfolio Management Board and the Service Management Committee, both comprised of DMs and ADMs. The Senior Director also makes presentations to the MPIB, Portfolio Risk Review Board, DGPOC and the Investment Prioritization Committee (ADM), the ADM and DG level Service Transformation Committee, Enterprise Architecture Review Board, DG Planner and DG level Pensions Integrated Committee.

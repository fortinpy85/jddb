The SEB SADM and AADM are partners in the management of the Branch s agile operating model that is fast, flexible, and collaborative, and where the SADM has the overall accountability of the Branch s mandate and budget, the AADM supports the SADM by providing management support in ensuring the Branch has the capacity to nimbly adapt to changing needs in response to a fluid environment. NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Led by five Ministers with responsibility for aspects of the portfolio and five Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. ESDC designs and delivers Government of Canada statutory programs that provide benefits for Canadians, including the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, Canada Student Loans and Grants, Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program, the Wage Earner Protection Program, 2
Canada Disability Savings Program, and the Federal Workers Compensation. ESDC s non- budgetary authorities consist of loans disbursed under the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act and the Apprentice Loans Act. The Department also delivers programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies, such as Passport services for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada IRCC), and for veterans on behalf of Veterans Affairs Canada. The Skills and Employment Branch (SEB) offers programs and initiatives that promote skills development and labour market participation, reinforcing labour market resiliency and efficiency. Specifically, these programs address the employment and skills needs of those facing employment barriers, and contribute to lifelong learning, building a skilled, inclusive labour force. Other programs support an efficient labour market by facilitating the integration of recent immigrants, the entry of temporary foreign workers, the mobility of workers across Canada and the dissemination of labour market information. The programs Increase skills and labour market participation of underrepresented groups to ensure all Canadians reach their potential and contribute to inclusive growth. Several key economic mega trends, including Canada's aging population, advances in technology, digitization, shifting global markets, and the transition to a low-carbon economy, are driving the challenge of maintaining a balanced labour market. In partnership with the SADM, the Associate ADM, SEB supports the DM, providing the agility and skills needed to deftly and swiftly manage rapidly developing and high-priority departmental files across a range of very challenging issues that implicate skills and employment policies and programs in real time. ' The Associate ADM, SEB represents departmental interests with Canadians, central agencies, as a member of several ADM-level interdepartmental committees and working groups charged with advancing the federal government's labour market and workforce development agenda. This requires broad consultation with public and private sector stakeholders on proposed initiatives, furthering workplace innovation, exploring options and alternatives. In this capacity, the incumbent makes recommendations, through the Privy Council Office, to the Prime Minister and Cabinet on measures to resolve labour market issues and several high-priority employment files The Associate ADM also serves as a key strategic advisor to the Ministers, the Deputy Head, Deputies and ADMs across the organization on emerging issues with implications for ESDC's strategic objectives for promoting skills development, enhancing labour force participation, and supporting an inclusive, resilient and effective labour market. The Associate ADM is relied on to provide sound and strategic advice that can be acted upon with trust and confidence on a complicated, high-profile and often sensitive domestic political stage. The incumbent's role is challenging given the six ministries involved requiring collaboration with six MinOs on discrete and often sensitive issues. Reporting directly to the Deputy Minister, ESDC, the AADM in support of the SADM s accountabilities and Branch's mandate drives the achievement of results, the Associate ADM advances monitoring, issues management, and corporate oversight and reporting on the status of major departmental undertakings, such as El policy modernization. El policy development and modernization exemplify the complexity of the Departmental undertakings in that, there are ' Standard on Evaluating AADMs, D.I.2.I.2 Shares the mandate, delegated authority and accountability of an existing EX-O5 position of exceptional size and complexity where both positions report to the same deputy head or associate deputy head and comprise a single shared point of accountability in a program or policy sector that cannot feasibly be subdivided. 3
complex policy, service delivery, legal, political and financial aspects that must be considered when making changes, including impacts on the El Account and effects on the contributions of premium payers. The Programs parameters are set out in the Employment insurance Act (EIA), the El (Fishing) Regulations, and the Insurance Earnings and Collection of Premiums Regulations. The El Commission is responsible for the application of the EIA and associated regulations while ESDC employees are authorized to act on behalf of the Commission. The Associate ADM leads the horizontal work with the Commission on the development of changes to policy and modernization efforts, which could touch on 9 different benefits and support programs. The Associate ADM employs the policy to service (P2S) continuum and directs consultations to gather a comprehensive perspective on the issues and solutions. The P2S continuum is well- suited to the fluid operating environment and the needed agility in adjusting policy and program courses. Rather than having to wait until post-implementation, it provides point-in-time assurances and insights to senior management to inform course correction. The working groups provide Branch-wide exposure to various policy and program streams and facilitates the movement of Directors General on cross-cutting issues. The Associate ADM consults with the Minister and/or Minister's Office to obtain the political perspective and key considerations. The Associated ADM directs research and intelligence-gathering to ensure a full understanding of the larger landscape, impact and potential reactions of stakeholders affected by proposed changes and then determines what authorities such as policy, financial, legislative and regulatory, are required to make a policy change and implement a solution. The Associate ADM collaborates with program officials to ensure a net benefit for skills and employment programs. The Associate ADM is accountable for skills and employment programs that support workers through different workplace transitions, including labour market entry, school to work transitions and adaptation to emerging on-the-job demands for current and new opportunities and ultimately, retirement. Examples include the YESS Program and Canada Summer Jobs, Student Work Placement Program, Community Workforce Development Program and Canada Retraining and Opportunities Initiative. Programs are delivered in close collaboration with II other federal departments, agencies, and Crown corporations. Again, the Associate ADM takes a horizontal approach in the development of skills innovation programs to identify and capitalize on commonalities with other Branch initiatives, among others. The Associate ADM is accountable to the SADM and the DM for SEB s central research production hub, data development and knowledge mobilization to understand how the labour market is changing. This includes annual and multi-year research plans and the building and maintenance of relationships with the Labour Market Investment Council and other organizations involved in the collection, analysis, dissemination of LMI nationally. Capitalizing on emerging technologies, the Associate ADM ensures the provision of geomatics services and support for SEB as well as ESDC and Service Canada. The Associate ADM is also accountable for ESDC s Job Bank that supports the integration of Canadians into the workforce by maintaining the Job Bank platform It also produces and disseminates labour market information products to facilitate exploration of the Canadian labour market and informed decision making on careers, education, and training. The Associate ADM oversees program assessment and qualitative analysis to monitor and assess the impact and effectiveness of benefits and support programs, as well as developing a clear understanding of their impact on the Canadian labour market and economy. These analyses also provide costing estimates for any potential benefits measure and forecasting of yearly costs. 4
The Associate ADM is relied on to establish and maintain strong relationships with key allies and government and non-government organizations and must ensure that partnerships are managed in accordance with SEB s, ESDC s and GoC's strategic priorities. This presents a significant challenge in leading and ensuring coherent engagement approaches and messaging across the Department and among OGDs. The fact that the incumbent has no direct authority over other federal departments or provincial/territorial officials requires diplomacy in scoping out and advocating for the mutual benefits of collaborating on solutions to skills and employment issues. As a member of numerous ESDC and Branch executive boards, the Associate ADM plays a key strategic leadership role, in top-down decision-making, driving the achievement of departmental results/outcomes, and advancing federal government priorities as these relate to, and directly impact on the ESDC, Service Canada and Labour Program mandate. Within the Branch and the Department, the Associate ADM must deftly navigate governance and decision-making paths in supporting the Senior ADM in overall accountability for Branch management. In this important support role to the SADM, the Associate ADM ensures that the larger branch context and considerations are factored into advice and recommendations to the DM. The wide-ranging nature of files, fast-moving dynamic and often political environment across the Branch spectrum makes this role highly complex, demanding sound judgement and nimble thinking. The Associate ADM provides expert management support to the SADM in ensuring the professionalism and continuity of the Branch s full range of corporate responsibilities, organizational planning and reporting, human resources management, as well as the strategic and effective governance of financial resources.

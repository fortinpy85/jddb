NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. The Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD) develops social policies and designs programs to ensure that children, families, seniors, persons with disabilities, the homeless and those at risk of homelessness, communities and others who are facing social challenges have what they need to maintain their well-being and facilitate their participation in Canadian society. ISSD works to build the Canada-wide early learning and child care system, ensures that eligible Canadians are provided with retirement, survivor and disability benefits, supports the long-term financial security of persons with disabilities, implements accessibility legislation and invests in the capacity of organizations and the non-profit sector to reduce barriers and promote access to opportunities for vulnerable populations. The major programs managed by the Branch are Early Learning and Child Care, Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care, the Old Age Security (OAS) program, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the Canada Pension Plan disability (CPPD) benefit and the Canada Disability Savings Program (CDSP). With the 2O2O Fall Economic Statement, the Government of Canada announced the creation of a new Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care (the Secretariat) to support the design and implementation of a Canada-wide system of ELCC. Situated within ESDC, the Secretariat negotiates and manages the federal bilateral ELCC agreements with provinces and territories; conducts ELCC data and research projects; and provides funding to further innovation and increase access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive ELCC programs and services in Canada. The Secretariat also provides secretariat support services to the National Advisory Council on ELCC, and the FPT Forum of Ministers Most Responsible for ELCC and its governance structure comprising a DM Senior Officials table and FPT Working Group. It also ensures close coordination with the ESDC Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Secretariat on inter-related areas of policy development. 2

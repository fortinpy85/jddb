NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is one of the largest and most complex federal departments and its mission is to support Canadians in living productive and rewarding lives, improve their quality of life and build a stronger and more competitive Canada. With a workforce of over 47,OOO, located in some 6OO locations across Canada, ESDC is adopting world class service delivery models enabled by modern technologies to provide more services online and deliver services in a way that responds to clients current and emerging needs. 2
To provide premium service delivery effectively and fairly, the Department's workforce must represent modern Canada in all its diversity, bringing different insights and encouraging change and innovation. Irrespective of workers sex, gender identity, ethnicity, the colour of their skin, sexual orientation, disability, faith, age, socio-economic background or lived experience, ESDC strives to create an environment where differences of thought and outlook are not only respected, but also expected. ESDC s Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan (DIAP) extends beyond the requirements of the Employment Equity Act and recognizes the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. Human Resources Services Branch (HRSB) drives the employee experience at ESDC to be the best in government through seamless, digital, diverse, inclusive, and user-centric services. The Department is committed to developing and delivering a strategic approach to HR management and renewal, enabled by integrated planning, policies, programs and services. In this context, the Director, Anti-Racism, Indigenous Reconciliation, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility leads the creation of innovative diversity and inclusion policies and programs with the objective of embedding inclusionary practices in the culture of the organization. The Director is accountable for the development, implementation and continuous improvement of internal and external policies and programs that are inclusive and free of systemic racism and barriers. This includes proactive approaches to identifying and eliminating systemic barriers to the recruitment, promotion and inclusion of Black, other racialized, Indigenous People, 2SLGBTAQI+, as well as persons with disabilities. The Director provides well-informed and integrated advice, briefings, and recommendations on DI (Diversity and Inclusion) and reconciliation policies and program issues to the Director General and involved senior officials across ESDC. The incumbent is expected to provide advice and recommendations on sensitive issues implicating ESDC s diversity and inclusion agenda, often under severe time constraints. The Director must provide sound and strategic advice that the Director General and other senior officials can act upon with confidence, always in consideration of the varied stakeholder networks and groups across Canada, which include groups within and outside the Public Service. The Director oversees the development and implementation of recruitment, retention, advancement and inclusion measures based on workforce analysis that reveals gaps in representation at the departmental level by Occupational Category and Occupational Group. The incumbent thinks creatively in directing the development of policies and programs that maximize virtual work opportunities to reach a larger pool of talent, in all regions of the country. As well, the Director ensures that hiring, talent and performance management processes are culturally sensitive and structured to remove barriers to appointment for Black, Indigenous, racialized people and persons with disabilities. Critical to the success and credibility of diversity and inclusion policies and programs are regular results measurement expressed in metrics agreed upon by stakeholders and networks. The Director leads an approach that focuses on changing demographics during an established period. The incumbent addresses areas of focus, engaging and collaborating with key stakeholders, diversity networks and bargaining agents and collaborates on the identification of solutions. The Director ensures the preparation of bi-annual reports with quantitative and qualitative analysis at the departmental level, tracking ESDC s progress towards achieving DIAP commitments and expected outcomes. As well, to gain an external perspective, the incumbent directs the review of Management Accountability Framework results annually regarding diversity and EE to identify areas of necessary improvement. 3
The Director is accountable for the development of mandatory and non-mandatory training plans that keep pace with the innovative DI approaches developed and employed by the Directorate. The incumbent directs the development of training such as the Richness of Diversity and Inclusion (RDI) and leadership training on anti-racism for executives. The Director also oversees the creation of safe spaces for ESDC s diverse workforce to share real-life experience and directs the capture and use of information from these shared experiences to strengthen ESDC' s training strategies. The incumbent oversees the development, delivery and continuous updating of continuous learning strategies to ensure the ESDC workforce is knowledgeable and sensitive to First Nations, Inuit and Metis cultures, histories and contemporary realities. The Director is accountable for the diversity and inclusion aspects of ESDC s role in the Joint Reconciliation Work Plan and in actively promoting the recruitment, retention and advancement of Indigenous employees. The Director represents the Directorate and engages with the Indigenous Employees Circle (IEC), Indigenous Coordination and Engagement Division in SEB, Internal Communications in Public Affairs and Stakeholder Relations Branch, College@ESDC and Regional & Branch Indigenous Perspectives Champions (IPCs). While this is a joint effort, the Director is accountable for working with key partners across the Department on the development of strategies that adapt internal and external policies and programs to better support Indigenous employees and strengthen ESCD's relationships with Indigenous Peoples. The incumbent plays a key part in assuring ongoing and effective governance of the Action Plan to ensure a coordinated and comprehensive process across policies and programs that generate positive impacts. The Director represents the interests and positions of the Directorate, Branch and Department in internal and external consultations and negotiations to broker agreement on policies and program positions that impact a heterogenous stakeholder community. The incumbent must be a trusted and credible representative of the Department when meeting with a range of groups, such as the National Steering Committee, the Unconscious Bias Working Group and the Building Bridges Working Group to share best practices and enable ongoing dialogue on diversity, EE initiatives and accessibility. The Director provides Branch leadership on engagement with and continued financial oversight and logistical support to the six employee diversity networks, which are an invaluable source of insight into the employee experience within ESDC. Among the networks, the incumbent ensures a safe place for members to air concerns and represent the views and interests of their members. Exceeding the requirements of the Employment Equity Act, the Director oversees the creation and growth of such fora as the PRIDE employee network, the inclusion of the 2SLGBTQI+ group in the next self-identification campaign, as well as the creation of a Transition Guide for Employees, their Co-Workers and Managers. The Director ensures consultation with Networks on the creation of new policy and program directs and seeks input from stakeholders that reflects their realities. The Director is responsible for approving the budgets developed by the networks and authorizing expenditures. The Director is accountable for providing input to communications and outreach plans and strategies that are developed in PASRB.

Communications plans include regular messaging from ESDC s Diversity Champions, Co-Champions and PMB members to establish a culture of inclusiveness that values diversity, combats racism and 4
addresses systemic barriers. Part of the communications strategy is the expanded use of different social media platforms to recruit from a larger talent. An important communications vehicle is ESDC s Workforce Demographic Profiles Report published annually. The Profiles include the Department, portfolio, branch/region and directorate levels to distinguish the information for all stakeholders. The Director uses the Profiles Report as a strategic tool that guides decisions regarding workforce planning and recruitment. To raise consciousness around diversity and inclusion, the Director oversees the planning and delivery of targeted recruitment events that informs various communities of opportunities in the federal government. The Director is accountable for the capture and maintenance of disaggregated DI data for use in bi-annual reports used to conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis at the departmental level and track progress towards achieving DIAP commitments and expected outcomes. The incumbent directs the development of information sharing agreements with other branches, regions and other internal/ external sources that will complement HRSB s data strategy as it relates to DI. Like the data captured in the annual Public Service Employee Survey results, the ESDC-wide data reveals new or emerging gaps and informs the development of strategies to address them. The Director oversees the review of ESDC s workforce representation of designated groups on a quarterly basis in all Occupational Categories and Occupational Groups as well as directing the review and analysis of an extensive and detailed inclusion survey to identify and remedy systemic discriminatory practices. Further, the incumbent directs the establishment and maintenance of an Employment System Review at the department level. The Director is expected to create and foster a supportive and inclusive work environment that is conducive to learning where differing positions are welcomed as part of the creative process, especially in terms of improving the Department's DI policies and programs. The position requires strong leadership skills and the ability to successfully manage a number of complex, time-sensitive and intellectually challenging files in a dynamic work environment.

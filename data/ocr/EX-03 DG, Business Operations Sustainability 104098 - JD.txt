NATURE AND SCOPE ESDC, which includes Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Overseen by four federal Ministers, the Department operates under the direction the Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development; the Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development and Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada; the Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development; the Deputy Minister of Labour, and the Chief Transformation Officer. The Department provides a range of programs and services that support Canadians from seniors, unemployed workers, parents raising young children, and students needing assistance to finance their post-secondary education. The Department fosters inclusive growth by providing opportunity and assistance to Canadians with distinct needs, such as Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, homeless people and recent immigrants; oversees labour relations, occupational health and safety, labour standards, employment equity and workers compensation in the federal jurisdiction; delivers programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies, such as Passport services for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada IRCC), and to veterans on behalf of Veterans Affairs Canada. ESDC also designs and delivers a number of Government of Canada programs that provide benefits for Canadians, including Employment Insurance, Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, Canada Student Loans and Grants, Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program; the Wage Earner Protection Program; and more recently, the Canada Emergency Response Benefits provided to assist individuals and employers experiencing income loss/financial hardship due to the 2O2O global COVID-I9 pandemic. Service Canada delivers many of ESDC 's programs and services through its integrated national service delivery infrastructure, which serves as the primary point of contact for persons seeking information or getting Government of Canada services and benefits. Services are provided online via the Internet, through Service Canada s Specialized Call Centres, and at more than 6OO points of service across Canada. Service Canada continues to grow and build its capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for services, in particular through strategic partnerships with other levels of government and community service providers where services can be consolidated to achieve cost economies and better serve local communities. The scale of Service Canada s national benefits delivery services network will continue to grow, due in part to Canada s changing demographics and aging population, and as additional points of service are brought on board to provide access for Canada s more isolated Northern, remote and rural communities. Recognizing the increasing demand and need to make services more accessible, the Department has committed to build a digitally enabled technology environment where clients will be able to access government services using their mobile devices and other electronic devices from anywhere, at any time, and through the platforms of any of its trusted partner. Within this context, the DG provides corporate leadership in the analysis and development of ESDC s Business Operations Sustainability program mechanisms, processes and new approaches to improved quality measures and risk assessment as well as in the development of evidence in order to understand the benefits/risks/costs of network and modernization service delivery to Canadians. The DG acts as the focal point to develop and implement a national programme strategy and orientation including frameworks, processes, systems and mechanisms for the delivery of the assigned Business Operations Sustainability (BOS) programme and services and ensure the integration, coherence and viability of the Directorate s strategic and business priorities with Service Canada Initiatives, ESDC s, the DM s and the Ministers strategic operational policy, program and service delivery goals and objectives. The DG is accountable for providing executive leadership in directing and enabling processes, approaches and Director General. Business Operations Sustainability Page 2 of 5 April Ist. 2O2I
tools that provide for effective performance assessment of the national implementation of the Business Operations Sustainability (BOS) programme and service delivery portfolio. The DG is responsible to ensure the development and coordination, in partnership with other corporate and regional ESDC partners, of strategies and operational policy/program positions with key clients, stakeholders and partners for major federal program and service delivery challenges. The DG is accountable to oversee the management of the evaluative process in order to enable the provision of expert and strategic advice that impacts national BOS frameworks and/or the design and conduct of operational policy and service delivery. The DG has an important corporate management responsibility in his/her oversight role in ensuring that the evidence gathered accurately depicts the Directorate s operational reality in order to fully comprehend the associated risks and benefits to Canadians and effectively articulate these issues to the ADM. The DG is responsible to champion the introduction of innovation, alternative service delivery and partnership mechanisms within the corporate operational policy and service delivery design and implementation. This is accomplished partly through partnerships and new working relationships with the Directorate s wide range of internal and external clients, stakeholders and partners. It also requires the DG to examine best practices and new ways of delivering services to assess their suitability and possible adaptation to the BOS programme. As well, the DG develops and conducts pilot projects with partners and stakeholders to test the applicability of new investment funding, policy and program approaches. In order to foster and advance a comprehensive future vision and strategic direction for the delivery of integrated strategies and Branch programming for the Business Operations Sustainability (BOS) programme, the DG establishes the Directorate as the centre of expertise for its Technical Debt Remediation and Workplace Digital Solutions initiatives, programs and service delivery strategies, approaches, infrastructures and processes. The DG must also implement an evidence-based and government-wide approach to program implementation and administration through support of cross-government/sectoral collaboration on horizontal modernization initiatives. The DG provides executive leadership to define the horizontal management agenda effectively, as well as develops and expands horizontal management networks, supporting information databases, assessment criteria, and best practices. In addition, the DG is required to promote the Department of Infrastructure Renewal portfolio s goals and objectives, by conducting extensive consultations with ESDC s corporate Branches and Regions and developing strong internal partnerships with key players. This internal partnership will allow to identify positions and requirements and to ensure they are considered in the development of national frameworks or operational policy or service delivery initiatives. The challenge for the DG is to effectively advocate and promote the Directorate s positions to ensure valid consideration by the corporate Directorates of the Branch, by the Strategic Policy and other corporate Branches and the Regions. In order to effectively communicate the necessary changes that may occur and address ongoing issues from the involved clients, stakeholders and partners, including the Regions and provinces/territories, the DG acts as a bridge between strategic priorities and operational reality and the divergent perspectives held by the multitude of organizations and parties involved in the Directorate s sphere of service delivery. As such, the DG serves as a key member of any corporate initiative taken by the Branch or the Strategic Policy Branch for the Business Operations Sustainability programme portfolio, and, in this regard, provides knowledgeable information and expertise related to the real program delivery conditions, the context and positions and priorities of the many parties involved. The incumbent's contribution is central to the development of required consensus that will be supported by all corporate and regional components of ESDC, the central agencies, OGDs, other levels of government; non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and key client and stakeholder groups. In developing the Directorate s integrated and coherent operational policy role and national program and service delivery frameworks and machinery, the DG ensures their responsiveness to the new government policy agenda and ensures these frameworks fully reflect the evolving regional realities, F/P/T partnerships and arrangements. The incumbent discharges a strong leadership role for the portfolio within ESDC and across the federal government. It is essential that the DG achieve partnerships and working relationships with the central Director General. Business Operations Sustainability Page 3 of 5 April Ist. 2O2I
agencies and OGDs concerning the portfolio to harmonize federal policy and program effort and capacity while avoiding duplication. In order to optimize the Directorate s success in implementing its varied and demanding mandate, the DG leads the development of client-focussed, results-based national plans; and performance measurement, and accountability and reporting frameworks which must reflect the priorities and interests of partner organizations requiring extensive liaison within ESDC, involved corporate Branches, the Regions and external partners. This ensures that the opinions of these key players are considered adequately and reflected in these critical management processes as well as to the quality of the reporting to senior executives and the provision of advisory services for issues requiring their attention and/or action. In carrying out the responsibilities of the position, the Director General establishes and maintains a wide network of contacts at the most senior levels of government and in this capacity, fosters and strengthens the Department's and the Directorate's business relationships with partners. The DG forges strategic partnerships and advances the Department's service integration priorities as well as negotiates and formalizes service-level agreements on technical debt remediation as well as workplace digital solutions. In addition, the vast array of contacts ensures viability of effective business continuity and disaster recovery planning initiatives. As a member of the ESDC senior executive team the DG contributes significantly to the achievement of the Directorate's strategic outcomes and priorities; serves as a key strategic advisor to the Assistant Deputy Minister and Chief Information Officer, SADMs and ADMs across the Department on emerging issues and developments with implications for departmental priorities and the business lines engaged in delivering pensions and benefits services. The DG is called upon to brief the Minister/s on priority matters linked to their Mandate Letters and commitments to improve the benefits provided for Canadians as these relate to the operational capacity and preparedness to support the delivery of the associated business lines.

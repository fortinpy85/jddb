NATURE AND SCOPE The Department of Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) was created in I993 from components of four major federal departments (i.e. CEIC, Labour Canada, Secretary of State and Health and Welfare Canada). It is a massive organization with workforce consisting of over 25 OOO members with an operating budget of over $2.5 billion and a program budget of over $57 billion. It is the largest single expenditure department with over 38% of the total federal budget, and is responsible for 97% of the federal governments transfers to individuals and 4O% of its transfers to the provinces. HRDC is widely decentralized and delivers its programs and services through II regions including NCR and over I,OOO services delivery points across Canada which include over 3OO major Human Resources Centres Canada, 2I tele-centres, IO Income Support Program mail-centres, a HQs and 5 Regional Information Technology Centres (ITCs), one Priority Centre over 5,3OO self serve kiosks, as well as numerous service delivery arrangements with other levels of government and Alternative Service Delivery (ASD) providers. The Government of Canada has identified several priorities for HRDC most of which directly impact on the program and service delivery of the Systems Branch. These include: the need to develop and maintain electronic systems and products to disseminate labour market information so as to maximize the participation of all Canadians in the workplace; a fundamental reorientation of the national social security system and its delivery; innovation in programming and in partnership arrangements to significantly reduce HRDC=s expenditures and contribute to deficit reduction; better value for tax-payers= money in federal investments in departmental programming and service delivery: greater responsiveness to the interests of clients and stakeholders. and new fiscal and service delivery arrangements with the provinces and new ASD mechanisms. It is within this context that the Director General, Architecture and Engineering is responsible for developing and implementing Information Technology business infrastructure plans, processes, procedures and standards to ensure the cost effective delivery of the Department=s products and services. The Director General is called upon to implement the strategic and operational frameworks to guide the Department in maximizing its investment in information technologies and in improving the delivery of services provided to clients. He/she is accountable for promulgating the application, information and technology architecture frameworks and standards for the Department including the technology architecture and those components of Application Architecture and Information Architectures that are technology based (desktops, servers, mainframes, messaging, networks, directories, security, application development environments, internet and intranet interfaces). The incumbent is faced with the challenge of promulgating standards and procedures which are essential to ensure compatibility, connectivity, data sharing and economies of scale across the Department, the Government of OGARC&ENG Revised 6.2.O2 Page 2 of 5
Canada and partners and to oversee that the departmental computing environment remains current within the industry and maximises available technology and interfaces. The Director General is responsible for ensuring that the Departmental Technology Infrastructure component of the Department=s Strategic Information Technology Plan includes the articulation of the technological architecture developed in cooperation with the HRDC business community, other Systems Branch Sectors and Departmental IM/IT committees. The Director General directs the development of an integrated approach to the IT business needs of the Department and ensures that the information management needs are integrated into the Departmental applications architecture.

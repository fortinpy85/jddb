NATURE AND SCOPE In recent years, the Public Service HR agenda has burgeoned and expanded in significance and complexity. The Public Service is in the midst of implementing a revitalized and modern HR management framework for the Government of Canada. Legislative changes have paved the way for a profound Executive Director, Human Resources Council Page | of 8 April 2OII
Public Works and Government Services Cunada Final transformation of the Public Service culture and fundamental changes in the values, attitudes and competencies of the HR community. Use of technologies will be maximized, systems will be modernized and technically accessible, and HR transactions will be simplified. An underlying principle of human resource management (HRM) modernization is that responsibility for HR management decision-making should be delegated, as much as possible, to front line managers. HR managers will focus less on administrative functions related to HR business operations and more on delivering HR services that are visible in business terms, serve both the employee and the organization, and support the continuous improvement of services to Canadians. The role of HR professionals will be critical in helping managers make decisions that are in line with important values such as transparency, fairness and respect. They will support needs analysis as well as sound HR strategic and operational planning, and help line managers to create a more effective and productive workplace and thereby improve their ability to achieve business objectives. In recognition of these changes, a number of departments have established ADM positions that are only responsible for HR, with many likely to go in this direction reflecting the overall increased importance of the activities and the responsibilities. Indeed, most DMs would have indicated that HR will be their biggest challenge over the next few years. The Human Resources Council (HRC) is an autonomous organization that represents the leadership of the human resources community in the Public Service of Canada. Based on a partnership between departmental HR organizations and central agencies and the Public Service Commission (PSC), the HRC acts as the voice for human resource management concerns and interests with respect to strategic HR matters. HR Council members work as business partners'of Deputy Ministers and Heads of Agencies and central agencies and the PSC, and their senior management teams. The Council's mandate is to act as a leader, a driver, an integrator and influencer in strategic HR management and work collegially with central agencies and the PSC. Specifically, the HR Council will influence the direction of, and provide support to, its partner central agencies and the PSC on the development of HR strategies and policies and the renewal of the HR community; address key elements of the HR management framework and key strategic issues affecting the HR function, in accordance with the HR Council vision and strategic agenda; identify Human Resources management needs and the operational impact of Central Agency and PSC HR policy initiatives and approaches on service delivery to Canadians, and the delivery of HR services within departments, agencies and separate employers; advise Central Agency and PSC member/partners when the capacity of the HR function needs to be addressed or taken into account; and identify and address issues related to HR service delivery. The HRC assists with the integration of the Government's business and HR planning at the highest level. It provides strategic leadership on HRM to guide the Federal Public Service in the creation of and transition to a sound, relevant HR strategic management framework and policies that reflect the HR environment of the twenty-first century. The HRC represents the views of departments, by virtue of its composition, and plays a key influential role with the central agencies, such as contributing to agenda setting and to the shaping of policies and implementation strategies. The Council is challenged, in the development and proposal of HR strategies, with the requirement to balance the interests of departments and what is acceptable to central agencies. The HR Council is comprised of 42 members, each of whom, preferably, sits on the Management Committee of their home organization and represents the position of senior full time HR Officer in their Department. The Council seats are distributed to ensure representation of: central agencies and the PSC; large, medium-sized and small departments; small agencies; regional organizations; separate employers; Crown Corporations; and the Association of Professional Executives of the Public Service of Canada (APEX). Representatives of the independent agents of Parliament, e.g. the Official Languages Commission and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, will be invited as required.

It requires an intimate knowledge of the machinery of Government, its infrastructure, the capacity to form partnerships, the roles and responsibilities of central agencies, unions, departments and committee structures. It requires highly developed communication, intellectual, conceptual and analytical skills and strategic thinking to influence Heads of HR and central agencies. It requires the cognitive capacity to understand and respond strategically to the complexities inherent in Service-wide transformation of HRM that underlines the ability of the Government to meet broad business and service goals. It requires acute sensitivity to the relationships among key partners in various organizations to steer decision-making in the direction that will most effectively serve common interests. The incumbent must have the intellectual ability to recognize the multiplicity and diversity of factors working together to achieve HRM modernization goals in order to influence strategic thinkers and stimulate the creation of strategies and policies that are acceptable from multiple points of view and that prevent as well as solve problems. The Executive Director must be able to question and challenge conventional thinking requiring intuition, non-linear thinking, fresh perspectives and information from non-traditional fields to generate new and imaginative ways to succeed. The Executive Director has broad freedom to act, circumscribed only by political will and budget constraints. HR modernization is a horizontal initiative that will have profound effects on the ability of the Public Service to better serve Canadians. The incumbent plays a key role in influencing thinking and the legislative, regulatory and policy infrastructure to bring about this far-reaching change.

iwi Emploi et D veloppement Employment and : social Canada Social Development Canada NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS The Department of Employment and Social Development (ESDC) Act states that ESDC is a continuation of the former Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, and that the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of ESDC under Article 5(I) of the Act extend to and include all matters relating to human resources and skills development in Canada or the social development of Canada over which Parliament has jurisdiction and which are not by law assigned to any other Minister, department, board or agency of the Government of Canada. Article 5(2) notes The Minister shall exercise the powers and perform the duties and functions (a) relating to human resources and skills development with a view to improving the standard of living and quality of life of all Canadians by promoting a highly skilled and mobile workforce and an efficient and inclusive labour market. The 2OI5 Speech from the Throne emphasized the importance of renewing a nation-to-nation relationship between Canada and Indigenous communities, based on rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. In this context the Government has made significant commitments to improve the socio-economic conditions of Indigenous peoples and their communities for a better future and quality of life. A key component of this effort includes ensuring that Indigenous children have a real and fair chance to succeed. Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) services are critical to providing a solid foundation for future success. The mandate of the department is to increase Canadian s economic and social security. The federal role in ELCC is largely through the transfer of funding to provinces and territories to support ELCC programs and tax measures and transfers to individuals and families to offset some of their child-care costs. Indigenous ELCC is an exception to this approach. In the context of Indigenous ELCC services, the federal government currently delivers the following programs to address gaps in provincial and territorial services and address high-need areas: a) First Nations and Inuit Child Care Initiative (FNICCI) administered by Employment and Social Development (ESDC); b) Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve (AHSOR) administered by Indigenous Services Canada (ISC); and c) Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern Communities, (AHSUNC) administered by Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The combined budget of these three programs is $I32M annually. In 2OI7-I8, the government undertook an engagement process in collaboration with organizations representing Indigenous peoples and on the bases of the feedback co-developed the Indigenous ELCC Framework with National Indigenous Organizations. Cabinet accepted the Framework as a guide for its future policies and released the Framework in cooperation with the AFN, MNC and ITK. At the same time the Government announced the IELCC Transformative Initiative with a budget of $I.7 billion over IO years and a new model of Indigenous programming that feature distinction based partnerships and collaborative decision-making In 2OI8 the Government approved the Indigenous Early Learning and Childcare Transformation Initiative and provided the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development authority: to finalize and publicly release the Indigenous ELCC Framework; establish a distinctions-based approach to ILECC implementation with the creation of three funding envelopes; expand federal support to the Metis and to all Indigenous peoples regardless of where they live in Canada; prioritize greater self determination; and, recognize the Framework as a new cornerstone for shared action for Indigenous ELCC. To support the successful implementation of the IELCC Framework a federal Secretariat was created under the auspices of ESDC to serve as a focal point for the federal government in the implementation of the IELCC Transformation Initiative. To this end, the Indigenous Early Learning Child Care Secretariat has been created under the leadership of the Executive Director, IELCC Secretariat with a mandate to co-ordinate and integrate IELCC programs in ISC (AHSOR), PHAC (AHSUNC) and ESDC (FNICCI) and to develop the inter-departmental authorities, financial policies and procedures to manage these as an integrated whole in collaboration with Indigenous leadership. Positioned under ESDC's Senior Assistant Deputy Minister Strategic and Service Policy Branch, and Chief Results and Delivery Officer, the position of the Director General, IELCC Secretariat is being created to be the federal focal Page 3 of 8

The Indigenous Early Learning Child Care Secretariat, under the leadership of the Director General IELCC Secretariat, is responsible for providing the leadership federally to work with Indigenous governments and organizations and with provinces and territories to improve access to high quality, affordable, flexible and culturally-based services for First Nation, Inuit, and M tis children and families that address the distinct needs of First Nations on reserves and off reserves, the distinct needs of the M tis Nation communities, and the distinct needs of the Inuit people, and does so ina manner that supports reconciliation between Canada and its Indigenous peoples. The IELCC Transformation Initiative will support the design, delivery and governance of IELCC services by the First Nations on and off the reserves for their people, the M tis Nation for its people, and the Inuit for its people . The IELCC Secretariat under the leadership of the Senior Assistant Deputy Minister (SADM) of Strategic and Service Policy Branch. Director is responsible for providing leadership within ESDC corporate headquarters in Ottawa, with ESDC regional offices, and with other federal departments to manage IELCC financial resources. In addition, the IELCC Secretariat under the leadership of the Director General, IELCC Secretariat, will also implement IELCC Data, Results and Evaluation Frameworks to demonstrate results achieved. The Director General or delegate will represent Canada at national and regional First Nation, M tis Nation, and Inuit IELCC partnership tables, and represent Canada in IELCC processes with Modern Treaty Holders. The Secretariat will lead efforts to align existing federal reporting for AHSORC and AHSUNC and introduce reporting (where there currently is none} for FNICCI, to permit all parties involved to get a baseline of IELCC information. The Secretariat will introduce measures to integrate the policy, programming and financial control systems of current federal IELCC programs with a more comprehensive approached to be co-developed with Indigenous people. As such, the Director General, IELCC Secretariat is responsible, either directly or through subordinates, for leading, the federal government whole-of-government approach to support greater governance and control by Indigenous peoples of all the ELCC services they receive from either the federal, provincial/territorial or local governments so as to improve both the quality and access to ELCC by Indigenous peoples and the reflection of culturally appropriate ELCC programming. The Director General, IELCC Secretariat is also the senior advisor to the senior management of ESDC and to the senior management of, Indigenous Services Canada (ISC)}, of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and any other federal department involved in some way with IELCC on the status of, results achieved, and challenges in the implementation of the federal horizontal IELCC Transformation Initiative. The position requires the mastery, of the theory and principles of policy development, program development, program results management, performance measurement, and reporting. It also requires a professional level mastery of the principles, practices, and methodology informing early learning and child care (ELCC) policy and program delivery, and in particular of ELCC issues for each of the Canada s Indigenous peoples, i.e. First Nations, Inuit, and M tis Nation. It requires knowledge of research that serve as basis for the development of strategic analysis and advice to enable, support and improve ELCC and IELCC programs; that will allow more flexible program terms and conditions required for cohesive child-care and early learning services for Indigenous peoples, as might be obtained through professional training in sociology, childhood education, social work, or a related discipline. The Director General, IELCC Secretariat requires a comprehensive knowledge of federal ELCC and IELCC mandates, programs, priorities and direction, the various funding programs, federal, provincial and territorial partnership arrangements, and Canada- Indigenous organizations fiduciary relationships. She/he requires a mastery of the theory and principles of collaborative policy development, delivery, and results measurement required to implement Section 35 of the Constitution Act I982 with respect to ELCC and IELCC in particular, where the Government of Canada patriated the Canadian Constitution, and in so doing, formally entrenched Aboriginal and treaty rights in the supreme law of Canada, of the implementation of the Cails to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and of the articles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Page 4of 8
iwi Emploi et D veloppement Employment and : social Canada Social Development Canada Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) which the Government of Canada has committed to implement. He/she requires an in- depth knowledge of the machinery of government, and the roles, relationships, and reporting requirements of central agencies, i.e., PCO, the Office of the Comptroller General and Treasury Board Secretariat. The work also requires a solid knowledge of various policies, acts and regulations governing federal programs, i.e., the Financial Administration Act, Accountability Act, Official Languages Act, the Access to Information and Privacy Acts, TBS Policy on Transfer Payments, Policy on Results, Directive on Results, and other related TBS policies and directives. The Director General IELCC Secretariat requires: a significant level of experience in highly complex, multi-party, program management; exceptional interpersonal skills in order to manage complex relationships, both within ESDC and with other federal, provincial, territorial, governments and with Indigenous organizations.

The Director General IELCC Secretariat must address at least four challenges. I. The detailed design and implementation of a new multi-departmental model of Indigenous programming, organized by distinction group (First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nation), with the primary building block being a co- managed funding envelope for each group that includes new resources and old funding in three departments and in which policy, program and funding allocation decisions will be made collaboratively with Indigenous leadership with the goal to support the development of regional Indigenous governance that is capable of managing the transfer of all federal ELCC programs and their integration with provincial/territorial funded services and delivering quality services. This will require extensive complicated negotiations with federal departments, provinces/territories and Indigenous governments and organizations. 2. Integrate the current federal Indigenous ELCC programs (AHSOR, AHSUNC and FNICCI) located in three departments into a comprehensive IELCC program for each of the First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nation that will be co-managed and that will improve access to quality ELCC services in the short term and will be transferred to Indigenous control in the long term. 3. Negotiate the governance structure of each of the distinction-based funding envelope and the National and Regional Partnership Tables that are essential to meet federal financial and accountability obligations and will meet the demands of Indigenous leadership. 4. Effectively use the targeted funding for data collection, research, evaluation and reporting to build an effective system to support the governance, management and delivery of this Initiative. The Director General, IELCC Secretariat has the responsibility to lead and implement federal direction for Indigenous ELCC and to represent fairly and competently the interests of all departments involved in this area in negotiations with Indigenous organizations and other governments. The Director General may also represent the Department of Employment and Social Development in meetings with other federal departments as the focal point for the Initiative and is to advance the objectives of the Initiative and achieve the results the federal government has committed to achieve. The Director General may represent the federal government directly or through subordinate executives in consultations and negotiations with provincial and territorial governments and with Indigenous people in national and regional partnership tables.

The ED IELCC has been given responsibility for FNICCI and associated investments (i.e. $54.9M annually). As well, consistent with IELCC Secretariat's mandate for improved federal horizontality in working with Indigenous governments there is movement for the ED IELCC Secretariat to assume greater responsibility for some of the investments currently under AHSUNC and AHSORC. For example, the IELCC Secretariat is currently working with the Inuit on a new IELCC Contribution Agreement that will enable the merger of all of their federal ELCC funding (i.e. the new IELCC investments, FNICCI and any AHSUNC/AHSORC investments they receive) under a single agreement with ESDC. This means that ESDC will potentially/gradually be assuming primary financial responsibilities for the $I32M in current IELCC program funding. Page 6 of 8

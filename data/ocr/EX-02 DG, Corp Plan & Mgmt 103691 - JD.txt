NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and to improve Canadians quality of life. As such, the department is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission, notably with an eye to building a twenty-first century economy for Canada and to strengthen the social foundations of the country. ESDC provides federal level management of the Labour Program which focuses on the workplace, the changes affecting the workplace and the needs of employers and employees in Canada and through Service Canada, supports Canadians and their communities by providing citizen-centred, quality service through a network of people partnerships and technology. Service Canada helps Canadians access the full range of Government services and benefits by providing seamless, comprehensive one-stop service to more Canadians in more communities, and delivering it in a way that ensures a positive service experience for Canadians. The delivery of government services and programs is complex because of the broad scope of the programming involved, the number and diversity of the clients served and their needs, and the multiplicity of stakeholders and partners involved. Within this context, the DG, Corporate Planning and Management, is responsible for providing corporate vision and leadership in several discrete yet often inter-related functional areas at both the department and branch level: the ongoing development and implementation of strategies, governance structures and systems; supporting responsive policy advice, adaptations, and timely interventions; integrating business and strategic planning; improving performance measurement and corporate reporting; resolving horizontal management issues; strategic integration of advice for senior management on corporate or government-wide initiatives and sustainable development; supporting the Senior ADM in managing the branch: and setting the plans and priorities for the directorate. The DG is accountable for developing the corporate capacity to strengthen departmental coherence by supporting the use of business architecture and business capabilities and by promoting collaboration, buy-in and sharing of best practices through support to communities of practice. The DG is accountable for a wide range of corporate renewal and management initiatives, including direct support to the Deputies through the Portfolio Management Board and other corporate committees; development of a renewed Strategic Research Framework, implementation of an enhanced governance structure, and coordinating the approval of an annual Departmental Research Plan; and sustainable development. The DG builds the branch's integrated resource management framework to achieve effective financial planning and resource management; oversees conduct of Branch internal and external audits, stewardship of information management (IM), and support services for executive management and Branch organizational renewal. As ESDC is a large, decentralized organization, the DG faces a significant challenge in providing leadership on the development and implementation of strategic planning, performance measurement and sustainable development, and research processes and frameworks. The Directorate functions as a strategic centre of expertise and innovative interface between the Branch, Senior ADM, other directorates, other branches and regions, other government departments, and central agencies. The DG leads activities to develop the solid knowledge base required to define program and stakeholder requirements collectively and to enhance the capacity to conduct planning, research, analysis and performance measurement at the branch and business line/program level. The DG establishes and sustains strong horizontal linkages to each branch directorate and other enabling branches (e.g. Chief Financial Officer Branch, Humans Resources Branch}, ensuring the commonality and consistency of advice; and directs and ensures the development and quality of the analysis and recommendations Canad andda 2 ofdes
Emploi et Employment and | Sf | D veloppement social Social Development Canada Canada used to advise the Senior ADM, Deputies and Minister. Leadership is provided through a modern, vibrant governance and accountability regime which emphasizes managing change and taking calculated risks in a rapidly evolving environment and leading rather than managing people. A horizontal governance structure ensures senior management's ability to address high-level risks collaboratively with partners across business lines and drive the alignment of strategic plans and improvements to project/program service delivery and implementation. This structure builds consensus through discussions around roles and responsibilities, and produces solutions to issues as they arise. The magnitude, complexity and variety of activities result in a constant stream of urgent, important and immediate issues, some of which require the attention of Senior ADM. The incumbent maintains an overview of issues, policies, strategies and events of interest to the branch as a whole. The DG faces a considerable challenge in orchestrating and implementing a cohesive operational policy development and priority-setting process for diverse and complex corporate issues. This demands exceptional interpersonal skills in building consensus within the branch through the Branch Management Committee and requires the DG to make recommendations to the Senior ADM. The challenge for the incumbent is to assist senior managers in focusing on, identifying and articulating their strategic management goals and initiatives; to identify gaps and immediate and future corporate partnership needs; and to build a comprehensive branch strategy to address these needs. The incumbent plays a pivotal role in providing an interface between the Senior ADM's office and peers in articulating the critical changes that are necessary in order for the organization to make vital improvements to its management processes and decisions. The DG also has a large influence on the management policies, paradigms and operations of all other directorates within the branch, acting as a linchpin between policy and corporate operations and thus enabling efficient vertical and horizontal management. The DG leverages branch corporate memory and knowledge across the management structure of the branch and ESDC and provides authoritative guidance and advice to managers across the branch on the implications of new, or revisions to existing, strategic corporate policies and frameworks on their organizations and associated program and service delivery, and assists managers in achieving required revisions and reorientations within their own spheres of accountability and operations. As ESDC s Head of Performance Measurement, the DG is a member of the Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee and is responsible, under the Treasury Board Policy on Results, for establishing, implementing and maintaining the Program Inventory in accordance with the Mandatory Procedures for Results Frameworks, Program Inventories, Performance Information Profiles and Programs and with the Standard on Tagging based on advice from the head of evaluation and in consultation with Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat officials; ensuring that the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat receives performance information, including indicator data and metadata, on all programs in the Program Inventory as requested; ensuring that Performance Information Profiles exist and are being implemented for each program; reporting, at least annually, to the Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee, on the availability, quality, utility and use of performance measurement data related to the Program Inventory; advising the Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee on the availability, quality, utility and use of indicators in the Departmental Results Framework; and demonstrating in their work the competencies for heads of performance measurement as established by the Secretary of the Treasury Board of Canada. The DG is a member of the Branch Executive Committee and Branch Workforce Management Committee and is required to be well-informed on a range of horizontal and department-specific program and policy issues. The DG provides authoritative advice to the Senior ADM and Deputies, and senior ESDC and Branch officials on new service initiatives and program proposals for the branch and provides strategic input to the ESDC corporate strategic vision and agenda. This includes making recommendations on management priorities and their concordance with ESDC s, central agencies and the government's policy and program agenda and priorities, and proposing alternative strategic directions and courses of action which may lead to more innovative ways of doing business and associated efficiencies in the allocation of resources, and overall reduction of expenditures on the delivery of Branch programming and services. The incumbent works with clients and branch and regional executives to improve their overall management of program and service delivery and individual initiatives while, at the same time, promoting a horizontal approach to problem solving.

NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS ESDC's mission is to support Canadians to help them live productive and rewarding lives, improve their quality of life and build a stronger and more competitive Canada. The Department builds social foundations and provides leadership in federal, social, labour market and economic programs and activities related to the development of Canada s human and social capital. ESDC s portfolio includes Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, Families, Children and Social Development, Labour, Seniors, Housing and Diversity and Inclusion. Supporting ESDC's multiple ministries, the Corporate Secretariat provides the Ministers with coordinated executive and ministerial services, coordinated cabinet and parliamentary affairs, and management of Access to Information and Privacy Act requests. ESDC s many programs are led by no fewer than twenty-six Assistant Deputy Ministers. The Department operates in a complex governance and accountability structure with intricate service delivery interfaces and models and an ambitious legislative agenda that includes high profile and often contentious funding programs. In this context, the Executive Director, Parliamentary Affairs provides strategic support to the multiple Ministers and senior officials on the leadership of respective programs and their responsibilities to Parliament. This includes managing the development of strategies to address the interests of Parliamentarians in both Chambers, tracking and reporting progress of the Bills, preparing advice for debates and Committee studies, and responding to Parliamentary questions. To succeed with these responsibilities, the Executive Director requires the skill to effectively communicate the depth, breadth and complexity of all multiple ministries national/regional operations and interjurisdictional complexities to a Parliamentary audience, as well as navigating the line between neutral, non-partisan advice and the political intent of the Ministers. In preparation for the Ministers appearances at Question Period and before committees, the Executive Director leads the development of briefings to address anticipated questions and must ensure the Page 2 of 6
substantive quality of the material contained within them. This functional interrelationship with Parliament demands that the incumbent continuously monitor the on-going business both within the House and Senate, assessing issues on a daily basis and directing the research and analyses of the facts within very tight time constraints and in close contact with the House Leader's Office. The incumbent fills an extremely complicated and often sensitive role from policy and political perspectives where excellent judgment must be used in reviewing and, where appropriate, challenging advice given the Ministers and senior officials regarding legislation and parliamentary activities Through careful consideration of the House of Commons and the Senate Order Paper-generated requirements, the Executive Director scrutinizes and analyzes the written questions submitted for information, determining their relevance, the area of concern within ministries and branches, and alerting the Ministers to potentially sensitive areas. This requires a vigilant intelligence gathering approach, so that Ministers and senior officials are provided information on issues and opportunities verging on real time. The Executive Director exercises a considerable amount of autonomy in interacting with senior officials and communicating direction, but typically consults the Corporate Secretary before determining a course of action on a politically sensitive file. The incumbent is relied on to broker solutions where Branches may be driving key issues on legislation in different directions. The Executive Director represents the Department at senior levels in PCO, with Ministers and their political staff, Branch heads, and senior departmental executives. These interactions demand superior interpersonal skills, a high level of personal credibility and a recognized understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing ESDC and the Government of Canada. The Executive Director provides strategic advice to the Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, Deputy Ministers, and officials at all levels across the organization on parliamentary procedures, requirements and strategies, and the management of horizontal issues. The time for developing advice to the Ministers is frequently very short and requires an in-depth knowledge of ESDC and its position on a broad range of issues, as well as the respective positions of the multiple ministers. It also demands the most up-to-date and richest information possible so ministerial decisions can be made with minimal chance of being overtaken by evolving events. Consequences of errors are high, as the Ministers rely on the accuracy and quality of the information and advice provided by the Executive Director The Executive Director has functional responsibility for all aspects of ESDC s relationships with Parliament and serves as ESDC s legislative and procedural expert. The incumbent is in frequent contact with the Ministers Offices and PCO to facilitate legislative processes and to encourage ongoing consultation and dialogue among all involved to advance the progress of legislation. The relatively short hierarchical distance from the incumbent's providing advice to Ministers and other decision-makers demands sound judgement, broad experience, and political acumen. The Executive Director is accountable for the research, development, and implementation of Parliamentary strategies for all major ESDC initiatives, which includes developing proposals for the legislative schedule, and recommending priorities. The incumbent works with the Parliamentary Secretaries through the Ministers Offices on Memoranda to Cabinet (MCs) and advises on best legislative path to move the MCs through the approval process. The Executive Director ensures Ministers offices are provided with strategic and procedural advice on all Parliamentary matters. This is a complex activity requiring a mastery of Parliamentary procedure and a strategic mix of independent and collaborative action in an operating environment where the incumbent faces increased demands, shorter deadlines, changes in Parliamentary procedures and high-profile issues. The Executive Director must establish and maintain solid networks among decision-makers in the Department and PCO, particularly challenging where issues are interconnected, and programs have competing priorities. These networks are an important source of real time information on legislation currently tabled and respective players positions on legislation under development. Based on these sources, the Executive Director provides situation reports that inform Page 3 of 6
changes in strategy. The Executive Director oversees the development of briefings for the Ministers on the government's strategic and priority issues in preparation for Question Period and appearances before parliamentary committees and ensures the progress and status of parliamentary issues are tracked.

The incumbent consults closely with (PASRB) to ensure consistent messaging and to draw on strategic communications expertise in smoothing the legislative approval processes. Once legislation is ready for introduction in the House of Commons, the Executive Director oversees the preparation of necessary information as the bill moves through the legislative process, including briefing binders, and other briefing material to support the Ministers before introduction of the bill and as necessary throughout the legislative process. As well, the incumbent develops and advocates for alternative positions that still allow the Department to advance its legislation. The Executive Director is accountable for the Departments management of Opposition Days when the Opposition Parties set the agenda and the incumbent must think strategically in anticipating motions and determining the best way for the Department respond. The incumbent carefully positions ESDC in terms of future, regular debates. The Executive Director must ensure that Ministers, Ministers of State and departmental officials are well- prepared for appearances before Parliamentary committees convened by the House of Commons and the Senate. Because committees enable detailed examination of complex matters and detailed study of legislation, the incumbent provides comprehensive preparations anticipating and taking into consideration the issues that could conceivably be raised in committee deliberations. The Executive Director works closely with Ministers and their offices, provides policy and procedural advice, and oversees the preparation of kits to support ESDC s committee members. The Executive Director oversees the preparation of binders for the Ministers Offices, required for proactive disclosure for every committee appearance by Ministers and Deputy Ministers and each one must reflect the detailed consideration of potential issues, so that those appearing from ESDC are fully prepared to effectively represent the Department. Where cross-cutting issues are being considered, the preparations must include analyses of the interplay among them and resulting fall-out. Further, based on the incumbent's procedural expertise, the Executive Director is also called upon to moderate meetings. When the various and numerous Standing Committees submit reports detailing their deliberations and recommendations, the incumbent is expected to review and comment on the reports through the Departmental lens(es). The Executive Director draws on extensive experience, procedural expertise, and thorough knowledge of the issues to make recommendations through senior officials to the Ministers. The Executive Director is accountable for the coordination of the development of Parliamentary Returns, including responses to Order Paper Questions, which are requested by MPs with the intent of seeking from the Ministry detailed, lengthy or technical information relating to public affairs. The volume and variety of Order Paper questions is challenging, especially considering ESDC s number of Ministers, Deputy Ministers, and Ministers of State. Order Paper questions require responses within 45 days and the incumbent must ensure that they are submitted within PCO deadlines to meet the deadline laid out in the Standing Orders. Otherwise, the involved Minister and Departmental officials could be called to appear before a Standing Committee to provide the reasons why a response was not submitted on time. The Executive Director is accountable for supporting Ministers participation in Question Period (QP) by coordinating the preparation of QP cards which contain a proposed response to an anticipated question as well as background information for the Minister. The Privy Council Office may also request QP cards from the Department's Parliamentary Affairs to support the Prime Minister. Further, the incumbent is accountable for the preparation of answers to questions posed during adjournment proceedings, where an MP who wants more information following a response given to their question can ask for the matter to be raised Page 4 of 6
again during the adjournment proceedings. The Executive Director is accountable for the coordination of the tabling of myriad ESDC s Annual Reports to the House of Commons and the Senate and oversees the tabling of other reports from ESDC s portfolio organizations.

The Executive Director oversees the development of work plans, budgetary and financial plans, approves re-allocations of resources between divisions, and ensures the effectiveness of the Directorate management control framework.

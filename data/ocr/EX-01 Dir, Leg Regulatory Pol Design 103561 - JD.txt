The Employment Program Policy and Design Branch provides a strong corporate | capacity to respond to the emerging economic and labour market needs of Canada and Canadians. This is accomplished through the development and implementation of partnership and renewal strategies and includes research, ongoing policy and legislative review, policy development and negotiated agreements with the provinces and territories.

The Employment Insurance Policy Directorate provides policy expertise on Part | of the Employment Insurance Program to the Minister and government on how to strengthen the core insurance function of El and ensure that it continues to respond to labour market needs. In terms of the operating environment, the scope, volume, complexity and pace of legislative and regulatory changes conceming El program is extraordinary, relative to other federal legislation, excepting perhaps the income tax act, and results from constant requirements for the El program to evolve to respond to changing labour market realities. This is in direct contrast to other legislation and regulatory frameworks which may change in a substantive way, only every decade or so.

Changes often require | the Director to apply extensive program policy knowledge, without error, in very short | timeframes in order to address Cabinet imperatives. The Director must be aware of legislative activities across the federal system, determine | how the agendas of other players impact on that of the Department, and develop strategies to mitigate those effects. He/she manages the legislative processes and guide initiatives through the system to ensure their steady advancement.

NATURE AND SCOPE Departmental Context The mission of Employment and Skills Development Canada (ESDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished by developing policies to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning and to work in the communities. ESDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life's transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. As both a policy, program and service delivery centre, ESDC is accountable for the development and implementation of policies, strategies, frameworks and initiatives that integrate and harmonize the mandates of the three organizational entities at the corporate level. This corporate leadership and coordination role ensures that the Ministers, Secretary of State, Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are provided with considered and consistent advice that represents the collective views of ESOC, Labour Program and Service Canada The Minister of ESDC is supported by one Deputy Minister and an Associate Deputy Minister for ESDC, and a Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada. The Minister of Labour is supported by a Deputy Minister of Labour, who relies on the resources of ESDC. The Labour Program promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment and Service Canada is the delivery arm of both Departmental and Government programs, services and benefits. The combined Department has a workforce of 24,OOO employees. Service Canada is located in all regions of the country through which the 2
programs and services of ESDC, as well as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone or through the Internet. ESDC operates in a complex governance and accountability structure as it supports two Ministers and a Minister of State (Seniors), two Parliamentary Secretaries; a Deputy Minister, a Senior Associate Deputy Minister and Chief Operating Officer, a Deputy Minister of Labour and an Associate Deputy Minister. The Department also has complex interfaces for service delivery to Canadians and shared corporate services through the Service Canada Initiative. The operating environment is made more complex by the primary jurisdiction of provincial/territorial governments for the delivery of early childhood development, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary programs, in addition to areas of shared jurisdiction. Program Context Evaluation is a vital component of the Government of Canada s accountability and decision making process. It ensures managers can operate effectively, by supporting their efforts to track and report on performance and provides decision-makers, up to and including the Deputy Minister, with neutral information to help them objectively assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and results of programs and policies and make informed decisions about their future (i.e. improvements, cancellation, reallocation, etc.).

Findings from performance evaluation activities must be systematically integrated into departmental strategic planning and used by management in developing new program initiatives in order to ensure the effective stewardship of financial and non-financial resources to serve Canadians. These findings must also address the need to measure the performance of programs/service delivery and to optimize resource efficiency and cost effectiveness (i.e. value-for money).

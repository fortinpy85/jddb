NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)'s mandate is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to help Canadians live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians quality of life. The Department supports Canadians throughout their lives, by assisting families with spending more time with their newborns, more high quality, affordable childcare options or simply more money to care for their children, helping students finance their post- secondary education, supporting unemployed workers and providing seniors with income security. ESDC is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission to strengthen the social foundations of the country. ESDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities related to the development of Canada s human capital. The Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) operates in a complex, multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder environment to develop and maintain the information technologies that underpin the delivery of socio-economic pensions, benefits and labour programs to Canadians. IITB ensures the department efficiently pursues their strategic, operational, and transformational agendas through sound, innovative, reliable, and secure IM/IT solutions and services. Of particular importance, tITB supports the management and evolution of the information technologies that underpin the operation of government's most important socio-economic programs, namely Old Age Security, Canada Pension Plan, and Employment Insurance, which delivers a combined I63 million payments to 8 million Canadians valued at approx. $II5 billion annually (estimated at 5.2% of Canada's GDP). In addition to the functions of Environment Management, Accessibility, Strategic Partnerships, and Contract and License Management described in the Organizational Structure section on the previous page, the DG, Enterprise Operations is responsible for the management of ESDC employee end-user tools, desktop/laptop/tablet equipment, and telephone and cellular services for more than 25,OOO employees across Canada. Lastly, the OG, Enterprise Operations acts as the Departmental IT Security Officer and is responsible for all IT security functions in the department. Overall, as described below, the Executive Director, Partnerships, Accessibility & Environments is accountable for establishing and managing the foundational IM/IT infrastructure required to build and deliver the IM/IT program systems and services to Canadians, to administer and operate the department, and to support employees in their day-to-day activities The Executive Director is accountable for the mplementation and management of IT development and testing environments for departmental projects and ongoing system maintenance. Working with ESDC branch projects, the Executive Director participates in the requirements analysis of each project to identify their individual needs. These requirements are translated into IT hardware and software requirements, subsequently provisioned and configured by Shared Services Canada Using this infrastructure, the Executive Director oversees the creation of IT development and testing environments. More importantly, the Executive Director is accountable for the implementation and management of the production environments that operate the ESDC program systems, such as Old Age Security, Canada Pension Plan, Employment Insurance, the learning systems, and the labor systems. The approach taken for the creation of these environments is similar to the creation of iT development and testing environments, however additional diligence must be taken to meet the volume. performance and interoperability requirements with other systems and organizations. Underpinning these systems, the Executive Director works wah Shared Services Canada to define IM/IT infrastructure solutions to support ESDC's current and future business requirements; monitor the day-to-day operational state of the ESDC environments; and, resolve incidents and problems on a timely basis. It is important to note that the number of individual equipment used to operate the numerous development. testing, and production environments is several thousand devices valued at more than $3OO million in IM/IT infrastructure. In support of these systems, the Executive Drector is responsible for the activities associated with the oversight, development, management and deployment of adaptwe technology strategies and solutions for employees with disabilities in the workplace (primarily vision, hearing, mobility and cognitive disabilities). This responsibility entails conducting needs assessments of employees with disabilities related to adaptive computer technology needs; and providing advice, recommendations, and/or workplace accommodations for these employees. Finally, the Executive Director is accountable for the establishment, monitoring, and renewal of hundreds of software contracts and software licenses used by the program systems to ensure proper accounting and usage. This includes ail the contracts for employee workstations (such as Windows and Office Suite), employee tools (such as SharePoint and GCDocs), application development tools, and the corporate applications (such as SAP and PeopleSoft). Overall, the Executive Director is responsible for managing more than 5OO contracts (with more than 3OO separate suppliers) When a contract has reached its end of term, the Executive Director collaborates with the appropriate IITB team to Page 2 of 5
conduct a competitive procurement process to renew or replace the contract. During the term of the contract, the Executive Director monitors the execution of the contract to make sure that the terms and conditions are met, and issues are properly escalated to the appropriate party for resolution. The Executive Director, Partnerships, Accessibility & Environments faces two key challenges. First, the management of the IT development, testing, and production environments (and the underlying contracts) underpins all of the services delivered by ESDC to Canadians and Canadian organizations. All issues, deficiencies, and outages are shouldered by the Executive Director. Given the more than 5OO applications, operating on thousands of devices, the role demands on very high degree of leadership, patience, and communications skills. Secondly, the Executive Director must manage the critical dependency on Shared Services Canada, who is responsible for the housing and operation of ESDC's IM/IT infrastructure that underpin ESDC's programs to Canadians (consisting of thousands of individual computing equipment and network devices). Given that ESDC does not directly control this infrastructure, the Executive Director must closely monitor the management of this equipment to ensure that it is always functioning efficiently, kept up to date, and is supported by the suppliers. DIMENSIONS ETENDUE DES RESPONSABILITES Executive Director, Partnerships, Accessibility & Environments PT [Operations I57 full-time employees and contractors Salary budget Estimated $9.9M Non-salary budget Estimated $48.9M Annual Projects ee Number of person years Over the past 5 years, projects have represented approximately 3O% of the workload. Employees are typically not assigned on a permanent basis to projects but work on demand Salary budget | Non-salary budget |_Not applicable a Total number of person years i Up to I57 full-time employees and contractors Total annual budget $58.8M Note : Impact of a system outage As an example, the information systems supporting El, CPP and OAS are at an increasing risk of failure. In fact, these systems have not been immune to outages in recent years: - In 2OI8, an outdated number format, built years ago into a CPP IT system resulted in a complete failure of the system until it was repaired. This outage directly impacted Canadians due to the inability to process all CPP workload for a full 24 hours, including the handling of client enquiries to the call centre. - In 2OI6, in an effort to gain efficiencies within the OAS system, a number of enhancements were implemented. Four days after implementation, it was discovered that the code was not behaving as intended and had to be rolled back to the prior version. The rollback and restoration of the data took another four days to complete, affecting OAS processing and service delivery. The changes incorporated simply went beyond the design of the system and caused unintended consequences. - Also in 2OI6, during the upgrade of the El mainframes, outdated code generated incorrect results when executed on the modern mainframes. The upgrades had to be halted for two weeks until an investigation was completed to locate any other instances of the problematic application code. The impact of such outages affect productivity, modernization efforts and in the worst cases, services to Canadians. For example, in the El processing cycles, the pay calculations are generated overnight and payments are issued before I pm the next day. This leaves little time to correct any errors that may occur with the pay processing cycles. Although infrequently, errors have occurred during the overnight processing hours that were not immediately corrected. The consequence is that all payments are delayed by a day, resulting in the late delivery of payments to 7O,OOO unemployed Canadians, valued at approximately $5O million. Page 3 of
The impact of a delayed OAS or CPP payment would be even more severe. For example, the large overnight batch processing cycle scheduled every month to produce OAS payments requires the execution of 325 batch jobs in a specific sequence in order to process the six milion payments to Canadians, typically valued at over $4 billion. The execution of those batch jobs is carefully monitored by senior IT experts in order to ensure that no issues arise. Any system error need to be remedied during the processing window. Extremely knowledgeable resources are required to perform this role at all times. SPECIFIC ACCOUNTABILITIES RESPONSABILITES PARTICULIERES ~ , I.

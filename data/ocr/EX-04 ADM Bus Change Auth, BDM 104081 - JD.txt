ESOC also designs and delivers through Service Canada s multichannel service delivery network, | a number of Government of Canada programs that provide benefits for Canadians, including | Employment Insurance, Canada Pension Pian, Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income | Supplement, Canada Student Loans and Grants, Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada I Education Savings Program; the Wage Earner Protection Program; and more recently, special social and economic measures programs, such as the Canada Emergency Relief Benefits provided to assist individuats and employers experiencing income loss/financial hardship due to the 2O2O global COVID-I9 pandemic. Service Canada s national service delivery infrastructure serves as a primary point of contact for persons seeking information or to access Government of Canada services and benefits. Services are provided online via the Internet, through Service Canada s Specialized Call Centres, and at more than 6OO points of service across Canada. This includes some 32O+ in-person centres, 239+ scheduled out-reach locations, and 32 Government of Canada passport offices. Through this network, more than $I2O billion in El, OAS, CPP & CPP Disability pensions and benefits are processed and distributed to Canadians each year, and which enable access is to other government programs and services, such as the Temporary Foreign Workers Program, Student Loans, Grants & Contributions, etc. . Service Canada continues to grow and build its capacity to meet the ever increasing demand for services. However, the technology infrastructure needed to serve clients is fragile and archaic in many respects, dating back in part to the I96Os and I97Os. Although the Department has made progress in introducing digital platforms, the shortfalls are evident through client feedback. At present, few services for mobile devices exist and clients also complain that the existing online systems, which were designed for the older service model, are confusing and not user friendly. Given these shortcomings, changes must be made in terms of policy and program simplification to make the process more easily understood, improve the client service experience, better enable staff , to provide enhanced client support, and also, to address the substantial income support benefits that remain unclaimed each year due to the barriers some clients face in accessing benefits services - particularly in Northern, remote and rural communities where enabling and expanding services to reach these communities is a priority for the Government of Canada. In line with its Service Transformation Plan, ESDC has developed a Blueprint for Benefits Delivery Modernization which sets out a clear vision for service transformation, identifies the inherent risks, and defines a target state operating model for 2O3O including the business processes, organization, technical infrastructure and information that will be required to successfully modemize and streamline the delivery of benefits services for Canadians. The position of ADM/Business Change Authority, Benefits Delivery Modermization Programme has been created with a mandate to lead the successful delivery of the Benefits Delivery Modernization Programme and ail steps necessary for the Department to realize its 2O3O service excellence vision. In this major role, the ADM will provide oversight and work horizontally with SADMs/ADMs across the ESDC and Service Canada business and functional lines to build the strategic working relationships required to successfully deliver the target actions outlined in Service Canada s Blueprint for Benefits Delivery Modernization and through this collaboration, manage the orderly transition to the new target state service delivery model. The Benefits Modernization Programme involves a multi-year large scale transformation to take place in tranches over several years and which is designed to deliver the target state client experience for access to government benefits, beginning with the Employment Insurance, Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security programs.

The ADM will oversee and ensure the sound, timely and cost-effective delivery of all parallel projects undertaken during each phase beginning with Tranche I through to completion. The incumbent will also establish a rigorous programme management framework to ensure the work carried out in a | planned, integrated and coherent manner, and that the multiple streams of work in progress at any : one time, are also thoughtfully and precisely planned, managed and coordinated. I The ADM will lead the business change aspects of transformation as a single matrix-managed ] integrated program of work, crossing all business lines, working horizontally with the SADM/ADM Workstream Leads to ensure robust programme governance and the adoption of best programme management practices in the areas of co-design and agile development such that the end results align with the needs of clients and staff both. While at the outset the ADM/Business Change Authority, BDM will initially be concemed with : modernizing delivery of the Service Canada benefits programs, the enhanced capabilities realized : through these efforts will enable Service Canada to scale for the delivery of other Government of ' Canada programs and services and in so doing, position it to meet rising service demands for many years to come. The enhanced capabilities will also see the implementation of digital technologies enabling improved access - via the internet and mobile devices, to these and other Government of Canada services through Service Canada, including access to the My Service Canada Account (MSCA), My Service Canada Business Account (MSCBA) systems. The new technologies will also help streamline registration, improve identify management, and facilitate data exchange with ESDC partners. The ADM will ensure the continuing alignment of the new service models with the Government of ; Canada s service and digital experience ambitions, and with ESDC's Service Strategy and Service Target Operating Model (STOM) both of which are focused on achieving integrated policy, program . and service design; integrated and horizontal service management; seamless, accessible client : service; and enterprise-wide solutions and capabilities. i As departmental lead, the ADM will be accountable, over multiple tranches, for working in conjunction with the various SADMs/ADMs and Branch leads (IITB, BDS, Procurement, Finance, Income Security Branches etc), to successfully deliver the end-td-end implementation of an integrated service target operating model for Service Canada to fully replace the out-dated service model. This will include with the BDS branch, the end-to-end redesign of the services provided . under the El, CPP & OAS programs; the redesign and implementation of changes to the business processes, organization, workforce, technology and information through which the target state Operating model and end-state client and staff experience will be realized; the identification for consideration by the relevant policy and program Branches, of changes to improve benefits service i delivery and program effectiveness; as well as in conjunction with the fITB, the procurement, installation and configuration of a new, modern payments infrastructure to support the delivery of government benefits both in the near future and over the long term. Close consideration will also be given to leveraging the Department's existing technology infrastructure wherever deemed feasible by IITB with a view to maximizing departmental returns on investment. i Major challenges of the position include the sheer scale of the transformation which will directly . impact on all aspects of Service Canada s multichannel network operations, including the technology infrastructure and the business processes through which the Department delivers El, CPP and OAS . and other benefits/services for Canadians and through which, clients access these and other Government of Canada programs and services. As such, it will be critically important for the ADM to work closely with IITB, the SADMs/ADMs at Headquarters, and with the regional ADMs to ensure full business change readiness as the Tranches (including new technologies) are implemented. It will also be vitally important to flag and work with these parties to ensure safeguard measures are in place to counter the potential risks as these changes go live .

The ADM will also be challenged to remain acutely cognizant of the rapidly evolving technology ; environment, in particular the increased use of Cloud and digital platforms, and to anticipate how these and other trends may evolve over the long term and impact on the business lines and regional network services given the significant investments that will be made to modernize and transform benefits delivery and the infrastructure through which Canadians will access these government benefits/services. Other significant leadership challenges will be faced in driving the agenda for change to be discussed at the DM & ADM level! BDM interdepartmental governance committees, and in the extensive collaborative work with the policy and program branches, IITB, Public Services & Procurement Canada, the Treasury Board Secretariat, the vendors, partner departments and other stakeholders where negotiations will be ongoing, many submissions prepared, contracts negotiated, . and plans developed and set in place to transition the organization to the new target state service model over the next several years. Major challenges will also be faced in managing the intensive collaboration with the core technology vendors and the systems integrators that, while not employees, form part of the BDM Programme team and will work alongside departmental staff as they strive to deliver on the Blueprint 2O2O benefits delivery modemization objectives. Successful conclusion of these objectives will only be reached when all Tranches are complete, their effectiveness proven, and the Department has realized its 2O3O service excellence vision. , As a member of the Service Canada senior executive team the ADM will serve as a key strategic advisor to the Associate DM, ESDC/Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Transformation Officer (CTO), the SADM, BDS, and SADMs and ADMs across the Department on the benefits delivery modernization agenda; provides comprehensive briefings and recommends approaches to surmount the many complex issues that must be resolved in order to move forward; and as the Service Canada lead in the work with partner departments and organizations to address their service delivery needs as part of the transition.

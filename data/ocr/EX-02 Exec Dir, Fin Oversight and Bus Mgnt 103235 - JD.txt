Nature and Scope Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the Department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. It is one of the largest and most complex federal departments. It employs over 24,OOO people and its activities account for almost one out of every three dollars spent by the federal government. The ESDC Portfolio (encompassing the Department, Labour Program and Service Canada) operates within a highly matrixed governance structure and operating model, supporting four Ministers (i.e. Minister of Families, Children and Social Development; Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour; Minister of Public Services. Procurement and Accessibility; and Minister of Seniors). Portfolio organizations operate with five (5) distinct sources of funding the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Employment Insurance Operating Account, the Canada Pension Base Account, the Canada Pension Additional Account, and the Passport Revolving Fund, and deliver a large number of diverse programs to Canadians. Overall Portfolio expenditures are projected to be $I38.3 Billion in FY 2OI9- 2O. ESDC has a broad mandate that includes social policies and programs, including Labour, and the delivery of a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives. For example, the Department provides seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education, and assists parents who are raising young children. The Labour Program contributes to social and economic well-being by fostering safe, healthy, fair and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the federal jurisdiction. Service Canada helps citizens access ESDC's programs, as well as other Government of Canada programs and services. Additionally, ESDC now has legislative authority to deliver services on behalf of other organizations and must therefore recover costs for these activities, which adds additional complexity to service delivery operations.

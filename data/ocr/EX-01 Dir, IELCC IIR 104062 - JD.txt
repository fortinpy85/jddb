NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS The Department of Employment and Social Development (ESDC) Act states that ESDC is a continuation of the former Department of Human Resources and Skills Development and that the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of ESDC under Article 5(I) of the Act extend to and include all matters relating to human resources and skills development in Canada, or the social development of Canada, over which Parliament has jurisdiction and which are not by law assigned to any other Minister, department, board or agency of the Government of Canada. . Under article 5(2) is noted The Minister shall exercise the powers and perform the duties and functions (a) relating to human resources and skills development with a view to improving the standard of living and quality of life of all Canadians by promoting a highly skilled and mobile workforce and an efficient and inclusive labour market;. . . The 2OI5 Speech from the Throne emphasized the importance of renewing a nation-to-nation relationship between Canada and Indigenous communities, based on rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. In this context the Government has made significant commitments to improve the socio-economic conditions of Indigenous peoples and their communities for a better future and quality of life. A key component of this effort includes ensuring that Indigenous children have a real and fair chance to succeed. Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) services are critical to providing children with a solid foundation for future success. This is especially true for Indigenous children, whose access to culturally appropriate, high quality, flexible and affordable ELCC empowers them with a strong sense of identity and establishes a foundation for their health, wellness and future success. Enriching ELCC programs and services can also holistically support parents and families to participate in their communities, cultures and languages. At the direction of the Prime Minister, the overarching goal of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development is to increase Canadian s economic and social security. Achieving this goal includes advancing work on a number of top priorities including working with Indigenous peoples to develop and implement a National Early Learning and Childcare Framework as a first step toward delivering affordable, high quality, flexible and fully inclusive childcare. In June 2OI7 federal-provincial-territorial Ministers responsible for ELCC announced an agreement on a Multilateral ELCC Framework to make enhancements to provincial and territorial ELCC systems that will improve the lives of Canadian children and their families with consideration for families more in need including Indigenous families. The federal role in ELCC is largely limited to the transfer of funding to provinces and territories to support their ELCC programs and tax measures and transfers to individuals and families to offset some of their child-care costs. Indigenous ELCC is an exception to this approach. In 2OI8, the federal government delivered the following Indigenous ELCC programs which served to address gaps in provincial and territorial services (including early learning and child care on reserve and in high need areas): a) First Nations and Inuit Child Care Initiative (FNICCI) administered by Employment and Social Development (ESDC); b) Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve (AHSOR) administered by Indigenous Services Canada (ISC); and c) Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern Communities, (AHSUNC) administered by Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).The budget of these three programs was $I32 million a year. These programs were criticized as a patchwork, and unresponsive to the needs of Indigenous peoples. The government launched an engagement process in collaboration with organizations representing Indigenous peoples and on the bases of the Page 3 of 8
ivi Emploi.et D veloppement Employment and social Canada Social Development Canada feedback co-developed the Indigenous ELCC Framework with National Indigenous Organizations. Cabinet accepted the Framework as a guide for its future policies and released the Framework in cooperation with the AFN, MNC and ITK. At the same time, the Government announced the IELCC Transformative Initiative with a budget of $I.7 billion over IO years. This Initiative is a new model of Indigenous programming that feature distinction based partnerships and collaborative decision-making. In April 2OI, the Government approved the Indigenous Early Learning and Childcare Transformation Initiative which gave the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development authority: to finalize and publicly release the Indigenous ELCC Framework; to establish a distinctions-based approach to IELCC implementation with the creation of three funding envelopes; to expand federal support to the Metis and to all Indigenous peoples regardless of where they live in Canada; to support greater self determination by transferring IELCC programs to Indigenous control: and to recognize the Framework as a new cornerstone for shared action on Indigenous ELCC. As an interim step, before transfer, direction was given to evolve federal programs to allow more flexible federal program terms and conditions required for cohesive child-care and early learning services under Indigenous control.. This approach to ILECC will serve as an example of a new policy approach for federal administration of programs with and for Canada's Indigenous people. The main elements of this new approach include: the creation of jointly managed funds for the First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nation; the creation of National and regional Partnership Tables of Indigenous and Federal government representatives to take decisions on policy, programming, priorities, funding allocations and service delivery; targeted support for the development of governance capacity; the authority to integrate current federal programs into one IELCC program; and the authority to transfer all policy and programming responsibilities for IELCC to regional Indigenous governance organizations. This is a transformative initiative for which there is no established guide or blueprint.. It is also complex in that the specifics of programs, partnerships and authorities will vary by distinction group (First Nations, Inuit and Metis Nation) and by province and territory. The decision to include Metis, in addition to First Nations and Inuit, as eligible beneficiaries for ELCC funding and to work in partnership with the Metis Nation governments and organizations is precedent setting and requires the development of new federal policies, program guidelines and financial and accountability instruments. To support the successful implementation of the IELCC Framework and this new policy approach for the federal administration of Indigenous programming, Ministers agreed that a federal Secretariat needed to be created, under the auspices of ESDC, that would serve as a focal point for the Federal Government for the coordination and implementation of this whole of government approach. To this end, the Indigenous Early Learning Child Care Secretariat has been created , with a mandate to co-ordinate and integrate IELCC programs in ISC (AHSOR), PHAC (AHSUNC)} and ESDC (FNICCI) and to develop the inter-departmental authorities, financial policies and procedures to manage these as an integrated whole in collaboration with Indigenous leadership. Positioned under ESDC s Senior Assistant Deputy Minister Strategic and Service Policy Branch, and Chief Results and Delivery Officer,, the position of Executive Director, IELCC Secretariat is being created to be the federal focal point for the federal Indigenous ELCC policy and programming and to lead the integration and eventual transfer of all federal IELCC programming to Indigenous control. The Indigenous Early Learning Child Care Secretariat is responsible for providing the federal leadership to work with Indigenous governments and organizations and with provinces and territories to improve access to high quality, affordable, flexible and culturally-based services for First Nation, Inuit, and M tis children and families that address the distinct needs of First Nations on reserves and off reserves, the distinct needs of the M tis Nation communities, and the distinct needs of the Inuit. This is to be done in a manner that supports reconciliation between Canada and its Indigenous peoples. The IELCC Transformation Initiative will support the design, delivery and governance of IELCC services by the First Nations on and off the reserves for their people, the M tis Nation for its people, and the Inuit for its people. Transformation Initiative. Positioned under ESDC s Senior Assistant Deputy Minister Strategic and Service Policy Branch, and Chief Results and Delivery Officer, the position of Executive Director, IELCC Secretariat was created to address the challenges as the federal focal point, with the assistance of two executive positions that form a secretariat, for the federal government to implement a federal horizontal IELCC Transformation initiative for developing governance policies, and processes for and implementing a transfer of IELCC programming to Indigenous control and establish a distinctions-based approach to IELCC which prioritizes greater self determination by the First Nations, Inuit, and the M tis Nation. The IELCC Page 4 of 8
ivi Emploi.et D veloppement Employment and social Canada Social Development Canada Transformation Initiative is intended to accomplish its objectives through the establishment of three distinctions-based funding envelopes and the transfer of those funds to Indigenous control. These could serve as the cornerstones for shared action, to be pursued at a pace and through a process of their choosing and serve as the basis for future investment in these programs. The Director, Implementation and Indigenous Relations is responsible for: - Leading the collaboration and negotiation processes, with the support of colleagues in Chief Financial Officer Branch (CFOB), Program Operations Branch (POB), Regional Offices and other federal departments and provincial and territorial governments, to develop mutually agreeable governance processes to manage IELCC financial resources and develop interim and longer-term IELCC funding agreements for negotiation with First Nation, Inuit governments to address the distinct needs and cultures of these distinct Indigenous communities in their management of IELCC funds to be transferred to them under the transformative initiative.

IELCC; - Representing Canada at these forums; - Directly negotiating and managing some Contribution Agreements and providing direction to Programs Operations Branch, Service Canada, Indigenous Services Canada and Public Health Agency Canada to negotiate and manage Contribution Agreements to affect the decisions of the Partnership Tables. - Implementation of the IELCC Transformation Initiative s data collection, results assessment, accountability and evaluation strategies with First Nations and Inuit; - Working with provinces and territories to address implementation issues and improve coordination and integration of IELCC programs; - Leading the implementation of the IELCC Data, Results and Evaluation Framework, for providing broader Secretariat support to IELCC partnership fora, represent Canada at national and regional First Nation and Inuit IELCC partnership tables, and represent Canada in IELCC processes with Modern Treaty Holders. * In the short-term, this will also include efforts to align existing federal reporting for AHSORC and AHSUNC and introduce reporting (where there currently is none) for FNICCI and to permit all parties involved to get a baseline of IELCC information. The level of effort required to work with ESDC s federal and Indigenous partners on the measures to address the requirements of these frameworks will be significantly greater than in the past, and all will have to be brought into consensus on required changes to Contribution Agreements, reporting and monitoring systems and financial systems to receive and track results. - Negotiating and implementing Transfer Agreements with regional First Nations and Inuit organizations that will transfer the responsibility for policy, programming and delivery to these organizations and putting in place the reporting and accountability framework that is required for these agreements; Providing strategic and tactical advice on progress in obtaining acceptable common positions for the processes required to implement the IELCC transformation initiative and the common understanding and acceptance by First Nation and Inuit, governments and communities of the risks, responsibilities, and training required for them to assume their independence and responsibilities as key components of implementing the IELCC Transformation Initiative The position requires a seasoned, in-depth knowledge of the theory and principles of policy development, program development, program results management, performance measurement, and reporting.

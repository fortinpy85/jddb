Manager IM/IT CS O4; Advisor AS O5 NATURE AND SCOPE HRSDC s mission is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and to improve Canadians quality of life. As such, the Department is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission, notably with an eye to building a twenty-first century I
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada economy for Canada and to strengthen the social foundations of the country. HRSDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for Federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities as related to the development of human capital; to promote an efficient labour market in part through Federal-Provincial/Territorial labour market frameworks; leading and reinforcing the development of workplace skills, including strong linkages and partnerships with employers; enhancing access to post-secondary education and lifelong learning; delivering government services and income benefits through the Service Canada initiative; and regulating and promoting fairness and health and safety in Canadian workplaces. HRSDC, through the Service Canada Initiative (SCI), supports Canadians and their communities by providing citizen-centred, quality service through a network of people partnerships and technology. This initiative helps Canadians access the full range of Government services and benefits by providing seamless, comprehensive one-stop service to more Canadians in more communities, and delivering it in a way that ensures a positive service experience for Canadians. The delivery of government services and programs is complex because of the broad scope of the programming involved, the number and diversity of the clients served and their needs, and the multiplicity of stakeholders and partners involved. The Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) provides the technological infrastructure to connect employees with each other, their clients and partners in order to deliver eighty billion dollars in benefits and respond to fifty million inquiries on an annual basis. The Branch supports business applications, access to data and the processing of benefit-related transactions. The provision and management of telephony and data networks, applications and data stores, Internet- based interfaces and new processes and technologies enable clients to engage with the HRSDC / SCI in new and more integrated ways and thus provide for greater service delivery efficiency. Itis in this context that the Director General, Enterprise Digital Solution is accountable for building and maintenance of effective client relationships on a client by client basis, to assist them in capitalizing on their investment in information technology and to provide productive IT solutions that offer client centric and effective service delivery and best value for the department. The DG is responsible for the development and implementation of the strategic management of horizontal issues, as well as operational framework to promote sound and effective clients relations management, which responds to policy direction from Canada and the Treasury Board Secretariat/Chief Information Officer, and is aligned with the business goals of clients. The SDG provides the leadership necessary to engage the ITB organization and its clients through the development and maintenance of partnership relationships with service teams across all portfolios in order to provide on-going life-cycle applications services and products that meet clients business needs; works with Client Executives to establish/re- establish Service Level Agreements and key performance indicators; and participates in Client Satisfaction Assessment Program (CSAP) process annually (minimum). The costs of acquiring the necessary hardware and software applications, particularly for the more complex applications, have made the investment in technology a potentially high-risk decision for the Department. The Director General is accountable for critical assessment of unfolding initiatives in integration and modernization of business processes, major projects and internal services to derive lessons for plans, standards and practices, to measure them against visions and outcomes desired and to recognize where lessons should lead to improvements in initiatives as well as altered strategic directions for overall IT solutions. 2
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada The Director General is expected to represent the Branch as the first point of contact into IITB for the provision of technology services; planning future technology initiatives, including the HRSDC IT- enabled portfolio of projects; provide advice and recommendations to the clients/regions and work with them through continuous processes involving constructive consultations, continuous monitoring of the status, any on-going or emerging management issues and planned independent reviews that begin when the project is being conceived right through to post implementation, and as performance assessment plays an important role in providing clients and the central agencies with an understanding of how well projects are succeeding, identifying performance indicators and reporting on results. The Director General is expected to provide recommendations and advice to major project committees and to report through the CIO on expenditures and submissions. This requires analysis of capacities within and between Branches/Regions, cost savings of proposals, cost management of implementation, and assessment of performance on an on-going basis requiring expertise, marshalling of in-depth information and working with clients in arriving at evaluations. The Director General is accountable for leading formal planning processes to support and enable the negotiation of overall Branch priorities for all branches ensuring plans can be executed within HRSDC technology resource allocations; overseeing the management of service levels and overall performance of service delivery: the development of mechanisms and strategies for the assessment and feasibility of IT enabled projects ensuring that the projects are well-defined and aligned with GoC and departmental direction, comply with Treasury Board policies; adhere to life-cycle practices, that risk strategies have been developed and that HRSDC has the technical and managerial frameworks and capacity to achieve desired results. The Director General provides recommendations to the CIO on the feasibility of these IT investments, with respect to alignment, organizational capacity to implement the project and to manage risk and the project's contribution to overall government objectives to reduce costs, to provide improved services, to obtain value for money and to contribute to the government's objective of an enterprise-wide IT framework. Largely due to competition for resources, the review and assessment of IT projects and the identification of risks/problems in the client proposals generates conflict at some level with the client organizations, and the incumbent must find innovate ways to broker IITB' s role in guiding the clients in the adoption of risk strategies and performance measures as part of the overall business strategy and ensure that the clients have the capacity and project management disciplines to implement their IT-enabled investments as efficiently and effectively as possible. As well, the single window role facilitates an overview of all |T-enabled activities across the department, and enables the incumbent to challenge assumptions in their approach and question whether the clients are leveraging existing IT resources effectively in order to achieve overall cost savings. The Director General is expected to provide strategic advice and guidance to clients on how better to align their programs and services with various departmental and government agendas, standards and direction; finding ways to manage demand (projects and services); and making sure commitments to clients are realistic. Ensuring alignment with GoC direction as well as balancing conflicting values requires that the Director General articulate the various optics that need to be considered in planning and managing major information technology projects. These optics include aspects of program deliverables, for example business problem assessment, target business vision and design, a strategy for transforming how the business actually operates and is constituted, and a creative approach to recognizing opportunities. These optics need to be seen clearly during the various phases of the review of the service, e.g., design, strategy and vision, as well as creating a 3
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada new system for delivery. There is also a need to develop a framework for evaluating departmental investment in terms of value for money, balance between security and transparency, service to the public, quality and timeliness; focusing on our core IT; making appropriate investments in our aging infrastructure and reducing our run costs in order to meet Strategic Review targets. Guidance provided through the Director General includes consultation and networking with clients and stakeholders to build strategic and effective partnerships at both central agency and departmental levels; elaboration of analytical frameworks for use in planning and managing; advice on project planning and integration; articulation of improved means of making business cases for projects that reflect the goals of transformed service provision; and feedback on all aspects of major projects undertaken in HRSDC. The Director General's role is in part one of analysis and advice, particularly on consideration of new projects, demanding leadership in bringing clients and the department into more creative approaches to project planning, conceptualization and management. This leadership is exercised at various key points in these processes, such as when clients present concepts and develop submissions, and when IITB is overseeing implementation and application. The challenge facing the Director General is difficult: to encourage, enable, and stimulate creativity in transforming business processes. More than a technical understanding of project planning and implementation, submission review and performance assessment is required. In addition, experience, judgment and wisdom are needed to recognize where thinking patterns miss key interconnections between ideas and technical means, and the business processes. Where the Director General can meet the challenge, such interconnections can be mace. The Director General ensures the development of a culture of excellence in the area of governance and horizontal management through specific actions, such as establishing formal processes to support and enable the negotiation of overall priorities ensuring plans can be executed within Branch resource allocations; streamlining of processes, and quality assurance/quality control; overseeing escalation management processes and managing client relationship and action plans; and is proactive in establishing and maintaining professional credibility to involve and influence key clients/partners and stakeholders [e.g., other HRSDC Sectors, Treasury Board, other government departments and agencies] to influence and negotiate acceptance of projects, program and management improvements, and to streamline review assessments. The Director General promotes action based on information sharing, partnerships, and risk management, to ensure program money is effectively allocated and spent. The Director General is expected to lead by example, and therefore is accountable for creating a working environment within IITB that is conducive to learning, and managed risk-taking, fosters capacity building, and reinforces the importance of investing in people. The team approach creates a highly collaborative and collegial structure, and employees are valued and respected. The incumbent is accountable for the establishment of priorities, the development of a work plan, and prudent management of resources. 4

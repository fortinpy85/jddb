NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Lead by six Ministers and six Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of over $I3O billion in programs, services and benefits, involving Canadians of all ages and their needs. ESDC's Public Affairs and Stakeholder Relations Branch is a full-service professional communications branch, providing internal and external communications in ESDC s complex governance and accountability structure, consisting of intricate service delivery interfaces and models. The Branch establishes the overarching corporate communications policy framework, provides authoritative strategic communications advice to ESDC Ministers and officials, and ensures the integrity of all aspects of the Department's Portfolio communications. In this context, the Director General, Strategic Directions leads PASRB's integrated business planning and provides a horizontal perspective on the identification of issues across the Branch. Given the number and variety of planning horizons, the incumbent must reconcile long term plans and key commitments with the management of urgent needs and cross-cutting issues.

The introduction and implementation of transformative models such as the Service Delivery Network requires the ability to view service delivery from a completely different perspective. While the design and evolution of service delivery models are Service Canada s responsibility, the incumbent must have the capacity to identify how the SDN model impacts the work of PASRB and to adjust the Branch's planning and corporate leadership role to respond to 3
the changes.

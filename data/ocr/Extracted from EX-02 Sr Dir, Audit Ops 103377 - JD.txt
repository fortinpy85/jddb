: excellence in partnership with other departments and agencies and with other orders of government. The combined Portfolio workforce exceeds twenty thousand employees who are located in ali regions of the country. The ESDC Portfolio operates within a complex governance and accountability structure that supports the Minister of ESDC, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of State (Seniors) and a Parliamentary . Secretary. ESDC is responsible for policy and program development and for the delivery of Government programs, services and benefits. To fulfill its mission, the Department is responsible for supporting a flexible, national labour market; increasing participation in the labour force; removing barriers to post-secondary education attainment and skills development; overseeing federal Jabour responsibilities: providing income support to senior, families with children and Employment Insurance beneficiaries; and delivering Government of Canada programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies. Included in these core roles are responsibilities for the design and delivery of some of the Government of Canada's most well-known statutory programs and services, including. Old Age Security; the Canada Pension Plan; Employment insurance; Canada Students Loans and Grants: the Canada Education Savings Program, the National Child Benefit; and the Universal Child care benefit. Labour Canada is responsible for overseeing federal labour responsibilities, including facilitating compliance with labour laws. occupational health and safety, and labour standards, as well as . assisting trade unions and employers in the negotiation of collective agreements and their renewal in federally regulated workplaces. The Program represents Canada in international labour organizations and negotiates and implements labour provisions in the context of trade liberalization initiatives. Through SC. the Department helps Canadians access programs, as well as other Government of Canada programs and services. at more than 6OO points of service across the country. In addition to in-person services, the organization serves the needs of Canadians online, by telephone and its network of program-based call centres. . Finally, through grants and contributions, the Department provides funding to other orders of government and organizations such as the voluntary and private sector, educators and community organizations to support projects that meet the labour market and social development needs of Canadians. ESDC will continue to evolve to achieve better results for Canadians while safeguarding taxpayers dollars. The Department's business transformation and modernization initiatives help the Department to reduce costs, enhance program integrity and improve service.

Finally, the Department is working to build a high-performing and adaptable organization by improving its management practices and its enabling infrastructure so that it can continue to meet Canadians needs in the future. The Department will continue to monitor risks associated with the implementation of the change agenda and their possible impact on the implementation of new initiatives, core programs and service standards. These risks are driven by three main factors: the scope and complexity of changes; the impact of change on the Department's employees; and, most importantly, the cumulative risk of : having such a high number of transformation activities being undertaken concurrently. ESDC will continue to rely on its mitigation and monitoring strategies, including enhanced monitoring by senior-level committees and through the continued implementation of the Information Technology Services Model, Investment Plan, Workforce Management Strategy and National Learning Policy to identify and react to any escalating risks in a timely fashion. In addition, increased monitoring and : reporting on various transformation initiatives will be undertaken to provide early indicators of areas requiring attention. This will make certain that public resources are used efficiently and effectively, and ensure that they are targeted to the highest level of departmental priorities to meet objectives. Page 2 of 8
The portfolio nature of the Department, as well as the complex financial arrangements with other Federal departments and agencies, and with the Provincial governments, presents major challenges ; to IASB that are unique in the federal government. The challenges are those of individual mandates for each of the Portfolio organizations, the inter-departmental and inter-governmental financial arrangements and the three distinct sources of funding (i.e. CRF, the Employment Insurance Account and the Canada Pension Fund Account). The diversity and visibility of Portfolio programs, services and benefits plus the magnitude of the expenditures involved (i.e. $IIO.3 billion annually) and the size of the workforce (i.e. over twenty thousand) are further challenging factors that complicate the . internal audit function. In addition to strengthening the delivery of programs, services and benefits to Canadians, the Government of Canada has placed a priority on improving financial management through the Office of Comptroller General (OCG). The Office of the Comptroller General of Canada works to strengthen financial management and internal audit practices across the federal public service and thereby support the overall effectiveness of public administration in Canada, and provides functional direction to the internal audit function and to the CAE. The Management Accountability Framework (MAF) for the Government of Canada is a key : performance management tool that the federal government uses to support the management accountability of deputy heads and, improve management practices across departments and agencies. MAF summarizes the vision behind various management reforms into IO high-level management expectations of deputy heads including, turning Governance and Strategic Directions into Results and Performance; promote a culture supported by strong Public Service Values, Learning. Innovation and Change Management, and stress Management excellence in the areas of Stewardship, Policy and Programs, Risk management, Citizen-focused Service, Accountability and People Management. The MAF articulates a set of government-wide expectations for sound management and establishes the framework of accountability for Deputy Heads to ensure that the conditions for good management are put into place. To that effect. the internal audit function is an essential component of the MAF as it supports senior management in the effective discharge of significant responsibilities by providing independent and ; objective opinions and advice on the effectiveness and efficiencies of operations. IASB plays a . significant role in terms of influencing management and supporting change management as it : contributes to enhancing accountability and performance by assessing departmental risk management, control and governance processes to ensure program targets, plans, and objectives are aligned with departmental objectives and priorities and are achieved: resources are acquired, . used effectively, and adequately protected; management and operations are effective and efficient; risks are appropriately identified and managed: quality and continuous improvement are fostered in the departmental control processes: financial, managenal, and operating information is accurate, reliable, and timely, with feedback to decision making mechanisms; compliance with policies, . standards, procedures. and applicable laws and regulations is achieved; and legislative or regulatory issues affecting the Department are recognized and addressed. The Financial Administration Act (FAA) and the formulation of new policies and directives aimed at strengthening the overall internal audit function in support of more transparent and accountable government. The Accounting Officer model recognizes the Deputy Head in each Department as the accounting officer who is accountable to the House of Commons and the Senate. It also provides the Deputy Heads and the Comptroller General of Canada with the added assurance independent from line management on risk management, contro! and governance processes (i.e. the internal audit function). The TB Policy on internal Audit (revised April I, 2OI2) contributes to the improvement of public sector management by ensuring strong, credible, effective and sustainable internal audit function ; within departments as well as government-wide. The Policy also provides a clear and integrated assignment of responsibilities for intemal auditing between deputy heads and the Comptroller General. Internal audit is critical to effective and credible governance and for improving the Page 3 of 8
independence, objectivity and overall effectiveness of the function. It also reflects a more principles- based and risk management perspective. The portfolio nature of the Department, as well as the complex financial arrangements with other Federal departments and agencies and with the Provincial governments, presents major challenges to IASB that are unique in the federal goverment. The challenges are those of individual mandates for each of the Portfolio organizations, the inter-departmental and inter-governmental financial arrangements and the three distinct sources of funding (i.e. CRF, the Employment Insurance Account and the Canada Pension Fund Account). The diversity and visibility of Portfolio programs, services and benefits plus the magnitude of the expenditures involved (i.e. $IIO.3 billion annually) and the size of the workforce (i.e. over twenty thousand) are further challenging factors that complicate the internal audit function. Internal audit plays a significant role in terms of influencing management, contributing to change management, as well as driving change. In order to achieve this internal audit must develop robust strategies and plans, including audit plans, programs and recommendations, which consider the size, complexity and diversity of ESDC' s programs and operations. In addition, the sheer volume of transactions requires the Department to have a strong control framework in place to ensure stewardship of assets. Internal audit must ensure that the strategies put in place include assessments of the control frameworks (including financial). It is in this context that internal audit contributes to minimizing errors due to control issues, which if not discovered could have significant cumulative impacts. The last few years saw a significant amount of modernization and transition at the departmental level, due in large part to the Deficit Reduction Action Plan (DRAP) following the Strategic Review (SR), including several major transformations which were under way. For the near future, the reality remains one of modernization. transformation and adjustment in a context of financial constraints. ESDC will continue to evolve to achieve better results for Canadians while safeguarding taxpayers dollars. Tne Department's business transformation and modernization initiatives help the Department to reduce costs, enhance program integrity and improve service. ESDC will also be making improvements to policies and programs by updating program design and implementing new service : delivery upgrades to meet the changing needs of Canadians. Finally, the Department is working to build a high-performing and adaptable organization by improving its management practices and its enabling infrastructure so that it can continue to meet Canadians needs in the future. The Department will continue to monitor risks associated with the implementation of the change agenda and their possible impact on the implementation of new initiatives, core programs and service standards. These risks are driven by three main factors: the scope and complexity of changes; the impact of change on the Department's employees; and, most importantly, the cumulative risk of having such a high number of transformation activities being undertaken concurrently. ESDC will continue to rely on its mitigation and monitoring strategies, including enhanced monitoring by senior-level committees and through the continued implementation of the information Technology Services Model, Investment Plan, Workforce Management Strategy and National Learning Policy to identify and react to any escalating risks in a timely fashion. In addition, increased monitoring and reporting on various transformation initiatives will be undertaken to provide early indicators of areas requiring attention. This will make certain that public resources are used efficiently and effectively. and ensure that they are targeted to the highest level of departmental priorities to meet objectives Within this evolving operational context, the Senior Director, Audit Operations acts as a senior advisor to the CAE and directs the delivery of intemal audit operations.

This evaluation of the internal audit activity is carried out once every five years to ensure the audit function conforms to the definition, standards and requirements of internal auditing and, to assess whether internal auditors apply the Code of Ethics. The Senior Director provides direction to the activities of multidisciplinary audit teams.

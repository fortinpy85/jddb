HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life s transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. HRSDC, through the Service Canada Initiative, supports Canadians and their communities by providing citizen-centered, quality service through a network of people partnerships and technology that helps Canadians access the full range of Government services and benefits.

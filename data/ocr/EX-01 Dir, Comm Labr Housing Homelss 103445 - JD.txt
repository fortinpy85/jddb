NATURE AND SCOPE In December 2OO4, the Deputy Minister identified HRSDC Transformation as an urgent priority, and an opportunity to: redesign and re-brand HRSDC in light of Service Canada, achieve policy-driven change and demonstrate leadership while minimizing change fatigue. The first task was to lay the groundwork for policy and service transformation. The February 2OO5 Budget signaled that Service Canada would be created by an internal realignment of HRSDC and SDC. In order to support departmental realignment, HRSDC has achieved the following major successes: -established trilateral working relationships (HRSDC, SDC, Service Canada) -negotiated functional and budgetary splits 2
-developed partnership arrangements for alignment -managed the federal Budget announcement and internal communications -initiated a personnel strategy -launched the Medium-Temm Planning (MTP) process. With the approval of the TB submission, and the virtual establishment of Service Canada, realignment has been achieved. Service Canada is part of HRSDC (and Social Development Canada (SDC)), but it operates as a separate organization. It requires a new set of relationships between policy and programs and service delivery HRSDC s challenges is to deliver its mandate and mission, which is to improve the standard of living and quality of life of all Canadians by promoting a highly skilled and mobile labour force and an efficient and inclusive labour market, by transforming the structure, processes and culture of the Department to align with the Government's priorities and the needs of Canadians It is within this context that the Director has been assigned the portfolios which serve the ADM, Labour and the ADM, Housing and Homelessness, DM, Labour and Housing and the Minister, Labour and Housing while ensuring all communications initiatives and activities are linked where appropriate with the corporate priorities of HRSDC and the policy and procedural frameworks of the Communications Directorate. The two client Branches of the Division are key players in delivering on the evolving federal and HRSDC visions and policy agenda and all have significant national programs and impacts and the Director must provide leadership for activities that underpin all Labour Branch and Housing and Homelessness Branch communications programs, services and activities, delivers key client Branches Communications programming to interna! and extemal clients, stakeholders and partners and promotes key priorities of the Government of Canada, the Ministers, DMs, Associate DMs and HRSDC s Executive Management team. The Director is responsible for providing and coordinating all Communications services to the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch and in changing traditional service delivery concepts and models. A major new thrust for the Division's activities and expertise is the need to provide advisory, capacity building and enabling services to its clients in the two Branches to assist them in the development of new information products and outreach approaches. In this way the Director has a strong impact on the success of the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch in reaching and communicating with their external clients, stakeholders and partners, including the general public and special target groups. 3
The Director has a dual role. In the first instance, he/she is a member of the Ministerial & Communications Services Branch and Communications Directorate s Management Team and its management Committee. In the second role, the incumbent is the expert Communications manager and service provider to the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch and their Management Team and Committee and programs. Through the first role, the Director makes a strong contribution to the corporate and national Communications vision, goals, objectives, priorities and strategic orientation of the Ministerial & Communications Services Branch. He/She is also a key member in the development and maintenance of the Ministerial & Communications Services Branch national planning, policy, procedural and service/program delivery frameworks. As part of this corporate Communications management cadre, he/she can be tasked with investigating national issues affecting the Communications Program and its responsiveness to senior management of HRSDC as well as to the Department's extemal clients. This involves the chairing of Committees and the leadership of Project Teams often composed of communications experts, consultants and program managers. Similarly, the incumbent can be assigned to represent HRSDC on a central agency driven, or an interdepartmental Committee or Project Team, responsible for analyzing a federal government-wide Communications policy or program issue or developing a major Communications initiative. As part of the corporate Communications responsibilities, the Director must establish strong horizontal policy and service delivery linkages with his/her colleagues in the Labour Branch, the Housing and Homelessness Branch, and Service Canada through regional communications support. Regarding the corporate functional positions, (i.e., Strategic Support, Corporate Communications and Media Issues), the Director must advocate the interests and priorities of Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch to these officials to ensure they are adequately considered and reflected in actions and initiatives they will take or lead. Similarly, the Director must also act as the focal point to represent the priorities and corporate strategies and business orientations of the Communications Directorate with the client ADM and his/her Management Team and organization. This ensures the optimal harmonization of the Communications Directorate and the Labour Branch and Hosing and Homelessness Branch 's communications strategies, orientations, products, services and systems and maximizes resource effort while avoiding duplication and inconsistencies. The Director also deals with his/her colleagues in the other Communications Divisions to ensure opportunities for joint action or integrated messages are 4
identified and acted upon. Through these contacts the incumbent also ensures consistency in service delivery and shares best practices and lessons leamed. While this corporate role is of importance to HRSDC's national Communications program, the greatest percentage of time is spent on its second rote and responsibilities; that is the Communications Manager and expert advisor to the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch. Due to the management model utilized in the Communications Directorate, the Director has great autonomy and authority to provide services, products and activities to the two client organizations. It is expected he/she will do so in accordance with the corporate Communications vision, priorities and frameworks however; he/she has the latitude to adapt these to meet the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch s specific needs and to further its outreach to their external clients, stakeholders and partners. A major challenge for the Director is in turning around a communications program that was previously reactive and issues-driven. This requires him/her to reorient the perspectives, work habits and service delivery practices of the Division's staff so they focus on the conceptualization and delivery of proactive and innovative services, products and activities. This needs sensitive management and handling to gain their agreement and acceptance of the new priorities and approaches. {t also requires providing training and development to staff members to assist them in adjusting to the new service delivery regime and its strategic and business orientations and directions. Part of the new approach is to facilitate the development of a better communications capacity within the Labour Branch 's and the Housing and Homelessness Branch s programs fo assist it in implementing new HRSDC priorities (e.g., enhanced outreach; greater access to HRSDC s services and knowledge/information bases through increased use of electronic and other leading-edge communications technologies, systems and products; citizen engagement, etc.). As such the Director must develop and sustain an awareness of the importance of strong communications delivery and support within the management cadre of the two client Branches and must establish a level of confidence with the ADM, Labour and the ADM, Housing and Homelessness, DM, Labour and Housing and the Minister, Labour and Housing, and the Branch Management Committees of the two Branches. He/She sits as a member of the Branch Committee of the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch and is the expert advisor and strategist for all policy and program initiatives and activities requiring communications support and/or products and services. In many cases the line managers do not fully realize the role communications can play to facilitate their activities outside of issues management and other traditional services (e.g., Ministerial Services, media relations, publications, 5
events), which have always been a strong requirement for programs. The incumbent must continue to provide strong expertise and support in these areas while inculcating an acceptance of the value of new communications services (e.g., public opinion research, social marketing, service and product testing). He/She must also promote the essential need for the early involvement of the Communications Labour, Housing and Homelessness Division in major policy and program launches and in conducting analyses and scans to determine the perspectives of the media and key client, stakeholder and partner publics for the Labour Branch s and Housing and Homelessness Branch s programs. As well, the Director must advocate the ability of the Division to play a pivotal role in assisting programs realize their priorities for better knowledge and information brokering services, and the development of products, services and major initiatives to promote their program's activities and services to Canadians. This is complicated by the fact that due to the development of the Service Canada model and the continued devolution, co-management and other alternative service delivery mechanisms, often the input and acceptance of other external parties are required in cases where the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch is involved in these shared service delivery scenarios. This can require extensive negotiation on the content of releases and announcements and on promotional material to ensure optimum profile and recognition of HRSDC and federal involvement and expenditures. A key function of the Director is to lead all communications planning for the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch and to develop and implement service contracts with ADM, Labour and the ADM, Housing and Homelessness and Management Committees. This requires driving a consensus among programs that have different priorities, service delivery platforms and often, different client, stakeholder and partner organizations. It is imperative that the Director gets these senior managers (e.g., ADM, Labour and the ADM, Housing and Homelessness, and Associate ADM's and DGs from the two client Branches) to focus on the macro-communications priorities and activities of their respective Branch in order to build the strategic and operational communications plans required for its major policy and/or program initiatives. As much as possible, the Director will act as a catalyst to promote and achieve the economies and enhanced effectiveness and profile that can be attained by integrated initiatives and messages. From the planning frameworks the Labour Branch s and the Housing and Homelessness Branch s daily and long term service delivery in all areas of communications flows. As mentioned earlier, the Director provides directly, or coordinates the delivery through or with the corporate Communications functional groups and external companies, of all communications services, systems and products. This includes ail traditional services (e.g., Ministerial and media relations, advertising, promotion, writing and editing, media analysis/monitoring, public enquiries, creative services, development and production of audio-visuals, 6
publications, events/exhibits, etc.) as well as state-of-the-art services (e.g., Intra/Internet, public opinion research, social marketing, Web Sites, CD-ROMs, etc.). The incumbent also ensures the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch is provided with appropriate information technology to support the cost effective management of all communications activities and to establish appropriate information linkages with the Service Canada Regions and other key external organizations. As the Labour Branch s and the Housing and Homelessness Branch's key communications advisor and service provider, the Director leads all national communications activities and initiatives related to the two client Branch 's specific policy and program areas. When one considers the scope and size of HRSDC, the challenge of effectively implementing the required Service Canada and other partner functional direction networks and frameworks is obviously large. In many cases the Director must assess, for the ADM, Labour and the ADM, Housing and Homelessness and their senior Branch management, the capacity of the service Canada Regional Communications and Program organizations to deliver the required communications services or initiative given their resource allocations and the competing priorities they face within Service Canada and at the Regional level. In many instances, he/she will, in fact, determine the strategic and business approach and will oversee the development of needed products and services and provide corporate direction and assistance to the Service Canada regional communications staff to assist them in the rollout of initiatives. He/She monitors the roll-out of these initiatives and also evaluates their impact and effectiveness in reaching target and general audiences and publics and in promoting the federal, HRSDC and Labour Branch and housing and Homelessness Branch interests and involved policy or program initiatives or issue. The incumbent is responsible for assisting the ADM, Labour and the ADM, Housing and Homelessness in best promoting their Branch s profile and policy and program initiatives, activities and issues across HRSDC and with national and international publics. This assists both corporate and regional managers and staff involved in, or affected by, the delivery of the Labour Branch s and Housing and Homelessness Branch's programs in best understanding their interfaces and responsibilities. This internal communications function is an important aspect of HRSDC's vision as it relates to promoting an understanding among staff of the overall new service delivery model of the department and the need to integrate its programs to the greatest degree and to also support managers and staff in adjusting to new policy and program requirements. The Director will not only oversee Labour Branch and Housing and Homelessness Branch specific internal communications announcements and activities but will contribute the assigned client Branches perspective and priorities to HRSDC's integrated internal communications initiatives, activities and messaging. 7
Another area of focus for the Director is to create and sustain stronger linkages with the Ministers and DMs Offices to ensure the timely exchange of information on critical issues and events involving the DM, Associate DM, and the Minister and other organizations and officials. It also enhances the development of integrated, timely, and harmonized communications approaches, strategies and support that benefit all federal players and obtain the best reception for HRSDC messaging, and the optimal public profile for the Department and the federal government. These linkages are also important for the development and maintenance of the schedules for the client Executive Managers and their best adherence with and support to those of the Prime Minister, other Ministers and DMs, and ongoing and projected federal initiatives and events. The incumbent provides the corporate leadership to the Labour Branch and Housing and Homelessness Branch in developing, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of their strategic and business communications plans. The Director must ensure that a consistent, integrated approach to communications prevails throughout the two Branches and achieves this by developing service standards and performance indicators in consultation with communications specialists in PCO, the Communications Directorate, and with managers across the Labour Branch's and Housing and Homelessness Branch s programs. The Director assists the DG in preparing for, or in sponsoring major presentations to the Department's Management Board and Executive Committees. Similarly he/she will be involved extensively in initiatives and activities involving the ADM, Labour and the ADM, Housing and Homelessness, DM, Labour and Housing and the Minister, Labour and Housing Offices, Cabinet, other Minister's Offices and Parliamentarians due to his/her awareness of the Labour Branch s and Housing and Homelessness Branch s corporate positions on policy and program matters and the need to coordinate these within HRSDC and with other federal departments, other levels of government and key external stakeholders and partners. In these roles, the incumbent discharges considerable influence on the strategic priorities and direction that will guide the Labour Branch and the Housing and Homelessness Branch and gover their interaction with domestic and international clients, stakeholders and partners during this period of fundamental reorientation of the federal human resources and skills development govemance and management regimes. The Director provides leadership and innovative management to the Division to ensure that all managers and staff are provided with authoritative and supportive guidance and direction, and receive training and development to continuously increase their productivity, expertise and competencies. The Director develops a management culture and philosophy that supports empowerment, teamwork, dedication and professionalism. The Director also contributes to the Directorate s overarching policy, procedural and management frameworks through 8

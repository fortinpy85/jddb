NO.: TBD LEVEL: EX-OI (P) EFFECTIVE DATE: = April I, 2O22 (P) GENERAL ACCOUNTABILITY Reporting to the Chief Operating Officer, who is the strategic lead for the Talent Management (TM) function, the Director, Talent is accountable for leading the TM function for the Canadian Digital Service (CDS), including providing operational management and strategic advice on TM to the CDS management team to ensure CDS acquires, retains and develops the appropriate human resources to meet its mandate and mission and shares the CDS TM strategy with clients to support them in their own TM goals; as the senior organizational adviser, ensuring organizational design and planning is directly linked to the CDS vision and senior management guidance of that vision; and leading CDS s procurement, travel, financial forecasting and administrative services. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE The Director, Talent is one of four positions reporting to the Chief Operating Officer, Canadian Digital Service. The others are Director, Policy and Strategy; Head, Internal Site Reliability Engineering; and Director of Engagement. Reporting to the Director are four managers: Manager, Talent Acquisition (AS-O6, 5 FTEs), accountable for employee recruitment and employer branding. Manager, Employee Experience (AS-O6, 4 FTEs), accountable for employee experience, employee life cycle (on-boarding, offboarding, alumni engagement), diversity and inclusion programs.

Manager, Internal Operations (AS-O6, 4 FTEs), accountable for sector operations including procurement, travel, financial forecasting and administration. NATURE AND SCOPE The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) has been created to support the Government of Canada in its commitment to provide the highest quality services to meet the expectations of millions of Canadian citizens and thousands of Canadian businesses in the digital age. CDS is housed within the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) so as to benefit from line of sight across government and close proximity to facilitate shaping the government-wide policies and standards which drive and scale this transformation. CDS s primary mandate is to focus first and foremost on delivery: helping departments and agencies improve how they design and deliver services to Canadians. It does so April t. 2O22
Director, Talent 2 by providing hands-on help, government-wide common platforms and components, and expertise grounded in delivery experience; it fulfills its mandate through three roles: As a very unique organisation, focused on building capacity, delivering solutions, and providing advice enterprise-wide, CDS is organizationally porous to the outside world and organizationally fluid within, in contrast to the vast majority of government departments which hire into and work almost exclusively with career public servants, who work within a well defined organizational hierarchy and become experts over a long period of time in supporting, or developing and delivering, specific programs and services to and for Canadians. Like all organizations, CDS has limited financial resources. Given its lean nature and ambitious multi-part mandate, it must carefully choose the projects and initiatives with which it gets involved. Project priority setting is complex and can shift, given that CDS work proceeds deliberately in phases with off ramp points and that the business owner has the ultimate authority over the project, although CDS's demonstrated expertise and proximity to the centre does give CDS moderate influential power. The above factors require careful strategic Talent Management to ensure that the right mix of high- capability, team-oriented talent is in the organisation with the right balance of skills, expertise and experience drawing from both the private and public sectors, in Canada and abroad, technically Proficient digital professionals and bureaucracy savvy employees and bringing their strengths together to fulfill the CDS mandate within its budget limitations. Further, CDS is not an organization in which the expectation is that employees will stay indefinitely; employees join CDS on a tour of service . This organizational talent renewal is critical to remaining contemporary with newly emerging service design methods and technology and the ways they can be employed. To make things work, the Chief Operating Officer, to whom the subject position reports, is charged with creating the talent/project strategic vision, through an understanding of the Canadian digital labour landscape and a CDS and enterprise-wide perspective. Talent Management As described in further detail below, the scope of Talent Management (TM) at CDS runs both broadly and deeply. It begins at the identification of needs; continues through sourcing and recruitment, assessment, negotiation and staffing; carries further still into pre-onboarding, onboarding, the employee experience (work environment, tools, culture, management quality, etc.) and retention; and goes even to departure (e.g. exit interviews) and the health of the CDS community of alumni who serve as informal ambassadors for the organization. Each part of this lifecycle is managed deliberately and continuously improved based on measurement and feedback. As with many other aspects of CDS operations, the mandate and impact of CDS s TM reaches beyond the organization s boundaries, across the Public Service. Through working in the open, sharing resources, changing rules and practices, and cultivating departmental counterparts teams to CDS s in the course of partnerships, CDS seeks to scale its TM practices across government. it is within this context that the Director, Talent discharges the following accountabilities. Shaping a Global Talent Strategy As further detailed below, the Director is accountable for supporting the CDS Global Talent Strategy that aligns and moves the business towards continued growth, innovation and improvement. Given its mandate, CDS requires specialized talent that can act as an effective expert partner across a range of clients whether on a large project or when making small but important innovative adjustments to their technology platforms and processes to better serve Canadians. This Strategy cannot simply be a short-term recruitment approach for a given type of talent, but must reflect CDS s mandate and mission as a specialized and flexible organization within Government which will actively manage its employees, over time, through their organizational lifecycle, ensuring that they April t. 2O22
Director, Talent 3 get the best from the CDS experience and that CDS and its clients get the best from them. This strategy, while flexible according to the needs of the day, must be durable over time, relying on principled and values-based employee relationships that reflect both individual and collective employee needs, balanced with CDS s need to also give its clients the best CDS experience. The Director is expected to help develop and recommend formal CDS policies and practices for the Global Talent Strategy, and ensure they are aligned with the Government of Canada s human resource legislation, policies and practices that underline its relationships with employees and support a diverse and inclusive workplace for all. Talent Needs Identification The incumbent is first accountable for supporting the COO/CDS by conducting a careful analysis of such factors as individual project talent requirements, specialized talent availability and gaps, the client's capacity and willingness to invest human and financial resources in change, and CDS' TM capacity to find or re-assign talent quickly when new priorities arise or, say, an individual's contribution to a particular phase of a project is complete. In effect, the Director plays a critical role in analysing and advising CDS senior management that there are enough people for the work (the right people) and enough work (the right work) for those people. This includes planning and making recommendations for both near- and longer-term requirements within a context of a rapidly evolving digital landscape where digital talent is in high demand and can be scarce. Talent Acquisition Following the needs identification process, which will be repeated over time according to changing requirements, the incumbent is accountable for assessing, developing, recommending and implementing specialized talent acquisition strategies and processes for both internal (to the government) and external recruitment that matches requirements; for leading specialized recruitment for CDS; and for providing advice to the Office of the Chief Information Officer and others on Talent (see TBS Partnerships further on). The internal specialized talent acquisition strategies may include a broad range of tools and approaches depending on the situation. For example, internally they could be based on staffing processes that will identify pools of qualified candidates who can be selected as the need arises. Optionally, there could be secondment opportunities when there is a shorter-term requirement, which is a common need for CDS clients. In terms of external recruitment, talent acquisition is a more complex process. First and foremost, the Director must develop and recommend a CDS employment brand as a way to clearly and consistently identify CDS to prospective talent as an attractive opportunity (this also applies internally). This branding is not effective unless it is supported by a strong marketing strategy based on providing more concrete evidence of CDS (and the Core Public Administration) as an employer of choice. Further, CDS funding is limited, so the marketing strategy must be targeted at places where it is most likely to produce results using the full breadth of modern tools that will speak to prospects (social media, industry events and associations, etc.) The above marketing strategy, although very valuable, essentially leaves prospects to self-identify. Therefore, it needs to be coupled with a highly targeted outreach strategy that, for example, starts with research using the tools noted above to make direct contact with qualified individuals to encourage them to apply for specific roles at CDS. CDS also builds out content and toolkits to support current and former CDS employees who act as brand ambassadors, speaking of CDS as a desirable employer. In building either internal or external recruitment strategies, the Director must carefully keep in mind that CDS is dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive workplace. Therefore, especially in external recruitment, the incumbent will ensure that targeted talent is identified that will support their Employment Equity and Diversity goals. This could include new choices as to where to market and collaboration with those who represent diverse groups. April t. 2O22
Director, Talent 4 Although the Director needs to build trust with all CDS partners, building trust with these key diversity communities, who have a history of exclusion, is paramount and communications must reflect cultural awareness and sensitivity if marketing and outreach are to be successful in attracting their members to CDS. Employee Experience The Director is accountable for leading the employee experience throughout the employee life cycle (including on-boarding, employment offboarding, and alumni engagement). Much of this work includes providing employee experience support and leadership with respect to day-to-day HR life cycle activities of client groups, including onboarding, offboarding, relocations, and other team member events. The Director works closely with the HRD across all the HR disciplines and Corporate Services Sector for financial and administrative matters to ensure the ongoing operational effectiveness of the people dimension of CDS. A Welcoming and Culturally Competent Work Environment The Director is also expected to lead the work to create an inclusive, welcoming and culturally competent work environment including retention and succession planning/implementation and training, coaching and best practices that will create a positive work environment, increase physiological safety and support CDS as an Employer of Choice. As an organization with a dynamic brand, but with limited resources, it is critical to maximize the value of every employee, both as a business and philosophical principle. The Director leads the Talent Team as a strategic business partner, focused on aiming to attract, accelerate and retain top talent, providing coaching and advice to leadership teams on all Talent related matters, including collaborating with leadership and across the organization in developing CDS goals, as well as guiding the people side of business decisions. Coaching and Leadership Development To support CDS as an Employer of Choice, the incumbent specifically leads the development and implementation of coaching and other best employee development practices throughout the employee life cycle, from onboarding to alumni status, so as to ensure employees have the capacity to perform their job and have developmental opportunities, a positive work environment, and psychological safety. The work requires specific attention to the extended management/leadership team to ensure these people leaders have the appropriate competencies and support to lead CDS employees and manage situations that arise. Examples of support include leadership development, coaching and problem-solving, program-based and tailored training, and developing a full appreciation for their leadership role in Diversity and Inclusion practices in CDS. Talent Support The incumbent leads the Team in the provision of Talent support and consultation to the business, answering employee and manager questions about employee experience, policies and other HR- related items, always with team member satisfaction as a priority; coordinating and supporting new Talent program implementations and creating and managing streamlined processes; and ensuring alignment with key stakeholders inside and outside the Team (HRD, CSS). CDS Strategic Advisory Role The Director is accountable for leading the Talent Team as a strategic business partner focused on aiming to attract, accelerate and retain top talent, providing coaching and advice to leadership teams on all Talent-related matters including collaborating with leadership and across the organization in developing CDS goals, and guiding the people side of business decisions. Senior Organizational Adviser April t. 2O22
Director, Talent 5 As a highly dynamic organization, CDS must be able to move quickly to meet new challenges, requiring organizational planning and design options for the CDS team structure that do not simply respond to change, but foresee it through HR planning and forecasting to meet changing needs. In this respect, the Director works closely with the COO/CDS and the senior management team as the senior organizational adviser ensuring that planning is directly linked to the CDS vision, with senior management guidance of that vision through changing circumstances and pressures on the organization, and that the organization is structurally enabled to anticipate them and is flexible enough to deal with unpredictable events that may impact CDS. The Director, working with the COO and CEO, is the functional lead for CDS-wide reorganizations and restructuring, leading on planning and execution, including the engagement of CDS team members as well as external partners such as HRD when required. Diversity and Inclusion As noted earlier under Talent Acquisition, Diversity and Inclusion are key elements of CDS s core values and their application does not stop after Talent Acquisition. The Director both promotes these elements across the organization as well as identifies and brings to senior management's attention any bias, perceived or otherwise, in decision- making processes. Further, the Director works closely with the HRD to develop and/or implement programs that support diversity whether on an individual or collective basis: for example, to prepare and implement appropriate career paths and training plans to promote a diverse CDS future management team. Further, the incumbent advises CDS leadership on specific or broad Talent issues and provides guidance to them on the impact of proposed business decisions from a team and culture perspective to ensure the business plans include people plans. Corporate Enabler The Director acts as the CDS corporate enabler, leading the teams charged with ensuring that the rest of the organization has what it needs to perform at an optimal level. Within this context, the incumbent is accountable for corporate (operational and administrative) services to this organization with offices in Ottawa and other cities: ensuring the development and implementation of policies; the ongoing management of executive, finance, administrative and HR management processes; facilities oversight; and procurement and accommodation. The Director ensures such services are provided and continuously improved without unduly burdening or reducing the flexibility and velocity of the organization. Key TBS Partnerships Although other critical partnerships exist and must be nurtured external to TBS, both across and outside government, there are two key internal partnerships the Director must build and nurture. First is the partnership with TBS HRD, which is functionally accountable for ensuring that the full- range of human resources policies and processes are conducted in an ethical and legal manner according to the governing legislation for each function (i.e. classification, staffing and labour relations, amongst others) across TBS. In working with HRD staff, the Director must be careful to balance the need for innovative solutions while respecting their role. Importantly, suggestions for innovative change must be presented as a proposed solution requiring the active and positive Participation of the partner. Although there may be a requirement to access support from CDS senior management for moving proposals forward, this must be done in a way that does not create animosity or harden positions, but leads to success for all. Secondly, the Director must build a close partnership with the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) as it is the OCIO that has functional accountability for IM/IT across the government. Specifically, the OCIO exercises a key professional role in evaluating departmental or cross- enterprise proposals, usually culminating in a Treasury Board Submission, of highly complex and high dollar value projects to determine their feasibility, cost (not just price) and overall value for April t. 2O22
Director, Talent 6 money to the taxpayer. In reviewing proposals, the Director helps in talent matching and assessing tech talent requirements for these proposals. Procurement The Director works closely with TBS, other federal as well as outside partners in order to enable departments and agencies to adopt modern software-, technology- and service-related procurement practices that are more modular and agile-compatible. The incumbent has broader responsibility for procurement enablement at CDS, including developing tools and resources from procurement templates compatible with modern service design methodology, to qualified vendor pools, to other procurement-for-delivery at CDS, and similar needs across government. The Director's procurement responsibilities also include overseeing the research and fulfillment of the team's needs for software and hardware to support their product and other delivery work, particularly in a distributed organizational context. As part of their change mandate, the incumbent also works to scale CDS solutions around modern tools to other parts of government through working in the open and clarifications or changes to rules, policy, and guidance. Managerial Leadership The Director is expected to champion the vision, mission, strategy and execution of the Talent team and to create a positive, flexible, innovative and supportive work culture reflective of their mandate and the mission of CDS as a whole. The Director also will provide periodic reports to update and track the strategic goal accomplishments of the Talent team and ensure that CDS leadership are advised accordingly and that all required TBS reporting requirements are met. The Environment CDS operates within a fast paced and responsibility-resourced environment, meaning human and financial resources are at a premium; therefore, priority setting at the strategic and operational level must be timely, accurate and able to respond to rapid shifts in the work while respecting human and financial limitations. Critical Risks/Challenges The rapid growth of CDS, its tour-of-service employment model, and its distributed nature put significant pressure on TM, employee enablement and corporate services, creating a significant challenge for the incumbent. So too does the diverse employment base of the organization, drawing on the private sector and thereby requiring deliberate, continuous effort to orient new employees to the federal Public Service balancing the need for familiarity with its core tenets (e.g. values and ethics, official languages and accessibility requirements) with an understanding of the key dynamics that impact delivery (e.g. resistance to change) and how to navigate bureaucratic obstacles. There is a need to build trust and respect with TBS HR service providers, while pushing HR practice boundaries that best serve a small, dynamic organization. The COO's policy mandate includes identifying and influencing policy change priorities and is complicated by many factors, such as: criticality of change; ease of change: ripple effects on other policies; appetite for change; timing of change; and the inherent risk of change. In recommending priorities, the Director must provide sound strategic advice to the COO/CDS in supporting the CEO in assessing and balancing these many criteria, and, as a corporate resource, the incumbent will also be challenged by many other factors when accurately advising the COO on CDS' current and future financial, procurement and human resource capacity currently available or to be acquired to support projects and, on this basis, to accurately assess project feasibility to be undertaken in the near and long-term. April t. 2O22
Director, Talent 7 Given the significant amount of influencing required to successfully advocate for changes to Government-wide rules and processes, as well as the relationship between government policy- making and digital delivery, there is a risk that the Director may face challenges in momentum as a result of institutional and individual norms, risk tolerances, and willingness to adapt or change by senior leaders. In light of CDS's relatively small organizational size, combined with its relative maturity (<5 years) as a central digital organization within the Government of Canada, the Director may face challenges in advocating for changes in CDS's programmatic mandate, authorities and funding, particularly in relation to service delivery departments and other central agency and digital organizations.

NATURE AND SCOPE The mission of Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive workforce, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development and delivery of policies and programs to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources and to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to enable Canadians to move through life's transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. Clients include individuals, businesses/employers, institutions and intermediaries, Provinces, Territories and other levels of government including Aboriginal government. The new Skills and Employment Branch was created in April 2OO7 and is the result of a recent integration of the former Employment Programs Policy and Design Branch, the former Workplace Skills Branch, the National Office of Literacy and Learning and a team responsible for the Opportunities Fund and Labour Market Agreement for Persons with Disabilities. The Branch contributes to enhancing competitiveness of Canadian workplaces and increasing the labour force participation of unemployed and vulnerable workers through human capital and skills development, insuring lost employment income; reducing barriers for people seeking to enter or re-enter the labour market as well as investing in, recognizing and using skills, in and for the workplace; and creating opportunities for Canadians through training and mobility. The Labour Market Integration Directorate is responsible for overseeing the program policy, design, analysis, assessment and delivery of the Foreign Credit Recognition
_3- (FCR) program to enhance the achievement of positive labour market outcomes for foreign trained individuals in targeted occupations and sectors; ensuring that foreign- trained workers have access to improved labour market information to help them make informed decisions about immigrating to and working in Canada via the Going to Canada Portal : supporting the FCR Office at Citizenship and Immigration Canada; leading federal implementation of Chapter 7 (Labour Mobility) of the Agreement on Internal Trade; directing the design, development, assessment and ongoing enhancements of labour market information tools and products to inform all Canadians with respect to occupational/career opportunities, and providing functional direction, advice and guidance to Service Canada labour market information services. Within this context, the Director is responsible for establishing and sustaining federal-provincial-territorial partnerships, as well as consultative networks with other levels of government, other government departments (e.g., CIC, DFAIT, Health Canada), HRSDC portfolio partners, NGOs assessment bodies and provincial/territorial regulators and various other stakeholder organizations in order to engage them in facilitating labour mobility across the provinces and territories. The Director leads HRSDC's component of this horizontal initiative by managing the horizontal governance structure made up of Ministerial, DM, ADM and DG level committees as well as various working groups. The Director is the Government of Canada lead for implementation of Chapter 7 (Labour Mobility) of the Agreement on Internal Trade, which helps to ensure inter-provincial/territorial labour mobility for workers and the recognition of qualifications across these jurisdictions. A major challenge for the Director will be to devise labour mobility strategies which require innovative and proactive approaches involving provincial regulators, management of federal-provincial-territorial relationships, and a range of sensitive labour mobility issues across the Canadian provincial and territorial entities. The Director faces major and continuing challenges in ensuring development of a truly Pan- Canadian approach to this highly complex, multi-stakeholder policy environment. Each jurisdiction has its own policies, programs and activities which impact on labour mobility and, as such, the Director must identify and engage partners at the federal, territorial, and provincial levels by managing a range of multi/bi-lateral fora, chairing or co-chairing bodies such as the Labour Mobility Coordinating Group and various working groups of the Trade Ministers' Tables. By coordinating and synthesizing the views and experience of these stakeholders, the Director will develop a roadmap by which professional regulators, provinces and territories can recognize and accept credentials, including those of foreign trained professionals and thus expedite and facilitate the movement of labour across Canada. The Director will also be responsible for establishing business linkages with the Trade Ministers, and the Committee on Internal Trade and for providing expert and authoritative advice, through the Minister of Industry, on sensitive labour mobility issues, including leading and guiding the work on developing recommendations on
_4- improvements to strengthen the Agreement on Internal Trade, Chapter 7 on labour mobility. The Director leads the ongoing review of provincial standards, and steers the establishment of inter-provincial Mutual Recognition Agreements which will facilitate the labour market mobility both of foreign-trained and domestic workers. This responsibility flows from the ongoing implementation of Chapter 7 (labour mobility) of the Agreement on Internal Trade, which provides for the mutual recognition of qualifications between provinces. In cooperation with the appropriate bodies (such as the Medical Council of Canada), the Director develops the Grants and Contributions to ensure that funding is available for the development of tools to assist them in the harmonization of professional standards. This responsibility also entails acting on behalf of the federal government when complaints are lodged (e.g. regarding eligibility criteria in national competitions managed by the Public Service Commission.) These interactions call for expert consensus- and relationship-building skills, as officials from other levels of government may harbour historical distrust of federal initiatives and many provinces and territories are critical of and sceptical about federal program and funding commitments. A key challenge for the Director is the formulation and implementation of multifaceted communications strategies to effectively raise awareness and understanding of labour mobility issues and build general consensus around proposed approaches, across government, as well as externally to the provinces and territories. This activity is complicated by the competing agendas of multiple jurisdictions and entities, involving provincial/territorial governments, portfolio partners organizations, NGOs and various other stakeholder organizations, each with their own cultural biases as well as political and/or profit agendas. The Director must play a pivotal role in paving the way for all parties to be able to recognize and reconcile their divergent views and motives in order to ensure coherent program directions. Labour mobility issues are very politically sensitive and media messaging around these can potentially lead to negative public perceptions. Consequently, the Director must exercise great care and diligence to ensure that Canadians do not feel threatened by an initiative that aims at expediting and facilitating the movement of workers, including foreign trained, within Canada involving high paying professional careers. The Director plays a key role in establishing strong linkages within the department in order to ensure appropriate integration, coordination and commonality of negotiation and consultation strategies and to capitalize on existing platforms. The Director must ensure the integration and alignment of the HRSDC agenda with those of various other government departments such as CIC, DFAIT and Health Canada, to ensure a coordinated and focussed approach across all of these organizations. To this end, the Director must demonstrate an exemplary level of people, communications and negotiation skills in order to influence future policy and legislative directions affecting labour mobility. This is a high profile initiative in which the Director must continuously monitor current events and advise the DG of any issues, both within and outside
-5- Canada, that might act as impediments to the federal government's strategies and priorities affecting labour mobility. The Director s activities are performed in an environment influenced by a mix of national, regional, and multicultural contexts affected by provincial/territorial legislation and by federal politics. The Director must not only recognize these environments but must also take them into consideration when formulating recommendations to the Director General. The Director must also be forward-looking, connected to emerging developments in national employment/immigration matters, able to assess the relevance and significance of new findings, and able to maintain a vast network of professional colleagues in the Public Service, in other levels of government, and across Canadian regulatory bodies and institutions in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration towards common objectives. The Director must also remain aware of proposed legislative and policy changes and be able to offer input in those areas which impact the departmental directions with respect to labour mobility matters. The Director is also responsible for drafting written and verbal responses on various labour mobility issues to members of the general public, Ministers, Members of Parliament, and special interest groups. The Director, as the policy and program expert on labour mobility issues, briefs the DG, Senior and Associate ADMs, other ADMs and Regional Executive Heads, the DM, the Minister and the Management Board and representatives of the provinces, as well as Various committees, on the implications of labour mobility for the economic and social growth of Canada. This responsibility includes the development of Memoranda to Cabinet and submissions to the central agencies and Cabinet concerning labour mobility program and service delivery initiatives and strategies. The Director plays a key role in the development of the policy component concerning domestic labour mobility in Canada and the government's socio-economic strategies for the efficient movement of internationally-trained workers, and in ensuring that the labour program reflects the Federal Government's commitments and obligations. The Director leads and provides authoritative advice on strategic HR and business planning matters to the Director General and other senior departmental officials and Is required to harness all available expertise within and outside the department to address strategic planning issues. The Director ensures that planning activities are aligned with the strategic directions of HRSDC and assists program managers In translating new visions into operational realities. The Director also ensures that HR and business planning activities are integrated with program development, strategy formulation, policy development, and priority setting activities at HRSDC by directing, participating in and contributing to overall departmental strategic planning efforts to ensure that these are timely and relevant to emerging policy directions and themes. The Director promotes HR and business planning within the Directorate to elicit a positive response to the associated activities and to highlight its value as an important management tool and represents the Directorate at various local, provincial, territorial, and regional conferences, workshops and seminars, as required.

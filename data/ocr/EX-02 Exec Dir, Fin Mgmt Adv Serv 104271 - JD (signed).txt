Reporting to the Executive Director positions are various structures and compliments, with CT- FIN-O4 and an executive assistant as direct reports. NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs.

Within ESDC, Service Canada serves as a single point of access for the Government of Canada s largest and most heavily used programs, such as the Social Insurance Number, the Employment Insurance program, the Old Age Security program and the Canada Pension Plan. Service Canada centres also accept applications for Canadian passports. Service Canada also partners with other federal government departments (e.g., IRCC; DFO; PHAC) for the delivery of specific services on behalf of partners, under cost recovery terms defined in Memoranda of Understanding, as well as delivers select services for the Government of Canada. The Policy Branches are responsible for the development of economic and social policies and programs aimed at increasing Canadians economic and social security while supporting and improving the well-being of families, children, seniors, workers, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities. In this context, ESDC aims at providing opportunities for Canadians to gain the skills and experience needed to obtain good quality jobs while supporting families, workers and seniors to have the appropriate financial security and the quality of life they deserve. The Enabling Services Branches are trusted business partners, leaders and catalysts of change and service excellence through the provision of modern, secure, effective and efficient information and technology, workforce management and financial management services that bring the greatest business value to the organization. The Chief Financial Officer Branch is accountable for the provision of expert leadership, vision, and direction for initiating a single point of accountability for financial management across the entire ESDC and its portfolio components, reporting to the Deputy Minister of ESDC. ESDC is one of the largest federal departments, and has a very complex financial structure, with various funding mechanisms used to deliver its mandate, including: the appropriated funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund; the Employment Insurance Operating Account; the Canada Pension Plan; and service delivery partnership agreements with other government departments. Administrative costs incurred by ESDC in the delivery of programs related to El and CPP are 2
charged to their respective specified purpose accounts and reported as revenues netted against expenditures under the Department. Within the CFO Branch, the FMAS Directorate is responsible for directing the provision of ESDC's corporate and business line financial management advisory services, including multi- year and annual financial planning, departmental resource allocation and management for all operating and Gs and Cs resources, managing the process to secure significant funding, financial analysis and planning, financial performance measurement and reporting, impact/cost analysis, and forecasting of long and short term trends. FMAS additionally develops financial strategies for, and costs major projects and activities, and advises senior management (CFO, Assistant Deputy Ministers, and 5 Deputy Ministers) on financial administration issues pertaining to program/policies and strategic approaches for the Department. It is within this context that the Executive Director, Financial Management Advisory Services is accountable for leading a team of highly trained specialists in the provision of strategic expertise, advice and services to clients. The Executive Director has a significant responsibility for providing expert advice in developing a number of major TB submissions and executive guidance. These include a significant number of complex TB submissions for changes to the Employment Insurance program, Income Security programs, and large-scale system modernization projects, as well as many Gs and Cs programs (e.g., the Youth Employment Strategy; the Homelessness program; the Canada Service Corps; and many more). This advice to branch clients is required so that funding is secured for the investment of considerable resources to enable government priorities, and so that funding is allocated to the right organizational units and are optimized to deliver program and policy excellence to Canadians. The Executive Director is responsible for overseeing and guiding the multi-year financial planning requirements and for ensuring that financial plans and investments are aligned with ESDC and GoC priorities and evolving strategic directions. As ESDC and Service Canada programs are at the core of citizen-centered program delivery and government decisions regarding new and changing programs, the incumbent is required to exercise considerable critical thinking, analytical and evaluative skills in assessing the directions, proposed plans and Priorities of major programs that all contend for funding to advance their program/service vision. The incumbent's role is critical to providing the necessary strategic advice and guidance needed by ADMs in decision-making relating to funding priorities, internal funding strategies and necessary TB submissions. Given the constant pattern of changing and new programs, the Executive Director must also ensure that the financial models for attributing resources to programs/services remains appropriate through ongoing monitoring and assessment of allocated funds, pressures and service delivery challenges. As the lead financial management analyst on program delivery, the Executive Director also plays a critical role in the service delivery costing of new policies, programs and G&Cs in support for the preparation of business cases and Memoranda to Cabinet. In this regard, the Executive Director is required to exercise a strong financial management challenge function that is crucial for financial situation decision making by senior management. This challenge function is necessary across the full cycle of expenditure management not only in relation to financial planning and budget allocation, but also across the cycle of monthly and periodic financial forecasting, the determination of supplementary estimates, and year-end expenditure management, as well as coordination with the Planning and Expenditure Management group on planning consolidation requirements. The Executive Director is required 3
to provide senior CFOB management (DG, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, and CFO) with an assessment of portfolios business line financial position to enable timely and comprehensive financial reporting and understanding of emerging issues and pressures. The Executive Director oversees the work of Financial Management Advisors in leading the strategic analysis of funding requirements and expenditure issues within assigned organizations, to analyze and develop creative solutions to reallocation requirements, to identify and examine new ways to manage pressures relating to existing and new departmental policy, program and project initiatives, and to develop contingency plans for shortfalls, including the need for additional funding from TB submissions. The Executive Director is responsible for the budgetary allocations provided to Central Management Cost Programs (CMCP) (e.g., accommodations, printing and personal computer devices), and for ensuring the tracking and monitoring of expenditures, in collaboration with the lead Enabling Branches. These responsibilities include the corporate review and analysis of financial management services planning and forecasting for each reporting period. The Executive Director is responsible for the budgetary allocations, and for ensuring the tracking and monitoring of regional expenditures, in collaboration with national programs. These responsibilities include the corporate review and analysis of regional financial management services planning and forecasting for each reporting period. Additionally, the Executive Director provides active support in developing and applying rigorous costing and reporting on the management of departmental projects. The work is performed in full support of the Comptroller General of Canada s priority to strengthen the Government of Canada s capacity to manage and deliver projects successfully. The Executive Director leads in providing authoritative advice to clients with regards to the cost drivers, contingency planning, and acquisition of resources for major projects including leading Financial Management Advisor direct reports on actions required to perform the FMA Attestation of due diligence and financial integrity for the department s ADM led Major Projects Investment Board. Ambitious transformation projects remain a continued challenge, requiring significant financial management support to address unique initiatives. ESDC lead ambitious transformation projects which remain a continued challenge, requiring significant financial management support to address unique initiatives. As the financial management lead, the Executive Director directs very complex costing exercises, as well as provides advice and counsel with regards to Treasury Board Submissions, business cases, partnership agreements, sources of funding, project authorities, project risks, and mitigation strategies. In addition, the Executive Director is relied upon as the main liaison between the department and central agency colleagues with regards to seeking funding and project authorities, often negotiating submission content with regards to funding and project authorities. Given the high-profile of certain projects, there is considerable scrutiny from central agencies in ensuring that robust financial management and costing supports project delivery. As GoC directions and decisions often influence changes in programs and G&C initiatives, the Executive Director is called upon to provide leadership and expertise in advising senior management on plans for implementing and funding new or revised programs/services, new approaches to service delivery, as well as providing financial solutions to continued instances of changing situations in financial management. The Executive Director's advice and guidance related to the risk-management of funds vs the resources received through TB submissions ensures that ESDC / Service Canada mandated activities can be achieved. The Executive 4
Director has a challenging role in briefing the CFO directly on the financial implications of TB submissions as they progress through their approval cycles in order to obtain CFO attestation. Cabinet submissions are official documents through which organizations seek authorities or approvals for implementing programs or projects, or for making large-scale purchases in support of government operations. The Executive Director is responsible for the due diligence review and evaluation of all elements driving financial information which will allow the CFO to submit expert conclusions and attest to the financial resource requirements, assumptions used, and risks, as well as risk mitigation strategies. The Executive Director acts as the main conduit in negotiations with both his/her client branches and Central Agencies with regards to departmental TB submissions and attends Minister's Office meetings with program clients to provide strategic financial advice and support. With continued increases in the number of G&C programs, the Executive Director is required to exercise oversight to the monitoring of spending for significant G&C s funding to ensure that Canadians/organisations receive the expected funding, and that the department makes the most effective use of funds. The Executive Director provides financial advice and counsel to the program and to ministers offices with regards to funding, spending, and risk management strategies, as well as overseeing monthly financial dashboards, trend analyses, and substantial monitoring of some $2.4 billion in Gs and Cs program funds. The Executive Director recommends strategies for the risk management of funding, as necessary and is accountable for developing funding related recommendations and advocating positions for the Director General with regards to resource management of Gs and Cs programs, while ensuring that the positions reflect the principles of fiscal discipline, and transparent and collaborative decision- making. This includes providing advice on financial strategies to advance/transfer funding from other G&C accounts where umbrella agreements exist with similar Terms and Conditions, thus enabling optimal solutions for spending G&C funding and maximizing financial benefits to stakeholders. Often operating in politically charged fora, the Executive Director must pragmatically analyze positions and facilitate the achievement of solutions. The Executive Director leads the provision of financial management guidance and expertise for the cost recovery processes for service delivery activities to other levels of government and external organizations. In providing strategic advice to senior management and organizations in establishing MoUs on service delivery, the Executive Director is required to understand the operational structure and delivery mechanisms of the partner organizations, to define the financial management frameworks associated with service delivery and to establish the processes for cost recovery. This also includes complex costing and cash flow analyses, as well as negotiations with both internal and external stakeholders to reach consensus on the recovery of costs for services delivered on behalf of other organizations. The Executive Director also is challenged when supporting the provision of financial management advice, tools, and guidance particularly regarding salary management, with increased oversight by TBS and recommendations by the Office of the Auditor General, and additionally supporting the Department and clients on government-wide expenditure management system (EMS) changes. The Executive Director is responsible for facilitating the use of data analytic tools and analyses necessary for branches to identify Phoenix pay issues, which have created significant employee underpayments and overpayments thereby substantially impacting branch/regional salary budget and expenditures. As employee pay situations change every two weeks, this presents significant challenges for the use of 5
departmental salary budget and requires complex strategic analysis and monitoring to allow financial resources to continue to be used effectively, while not being exceeded. In addition, with the recent focus on more accountable and open government, Estimates Reform aims to improve Parliamentarians ability to scrutinize government spending. This impacts the timing of the tabling of the Main Estimates; the scope and accounting methods used in the Estimates and the Budget; changes to the current vote structure; and changes to the Departmental Plan (DP) and the Departmental Results Report (ORR). As the lead financial expert for clients, the Executive Director is responsible for providing clients with advice and guidance regarding new responsibilities for TBS accountability reporting, Main Estimates, Supplementary Estimates, and input for the development of the DP and the DRR. The work requires a broad and in-depth knowledge of the theories, principles and techniques related to financial management, modern comptrollership, risk management, strategic analysis, policy analysis, performance measurement and improvement, negotiation, as well as of the interrelationships, variables and competing demands of Service Canada and ESDC. Strong managerial and leadership skills are required to manage a broad scope of activities in a constantly evolving and challenging environment that is atypical of financial management responsibilities in other federal organizations. As the source of expertise on all aspects of financial management services, the Executive Director is also positioned to identify new or evolving issues in the implementation of new programs, services, systems, etc., which require solutions in the development or modification of departmental financial policies, systems, coding and internal controls. The Executive Director is called upon to deliver regular briefings to the ADMs and COO on organizational units financial situation, financial aspects of TB submissions, the status of G&Cs and major projects, while also ensuring the provision of financial information relating to House Cards and QP requests relating to Main and Supplementary Estimates for the department.

Each Director is assigned a particular economic or geographic sector in the Region. NATURE AND SCOPE Program Context HRSDC s mission is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and to improve Canadians quality of life. As such, the department is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission, notably with an eye to building a twenty-first century economy for Canada and to strengthen the social foundations of the country. HRSDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities as related to the development of human capital; to promote an efficient labour market in part through Federal-Provincial/Territorial labour market frameworks and agreements; leading and reinforcing the development of workplace skills, including strong linkages and partnerships with employers; enhancing access to post-secondary education and lifelong learning; delivering government services and income benefits through the Service Canada Initiative; and regulating and promoting fairness and health and safety in Canadian workplaces. The regional organizations of the SCI represent the primary focal points for the delivery of services and benefits to Canadians on behalf of the Government of Canada. As such, the EHSMs are supported by five Executive Directors as noted above who are each responsible for managing a designated business stream. The regional Labour Market and Social Development Programs business stream is responsible for developing and implementing the Human Resources Skills Development Canada / Service Canada Initiative service delivery strategy. More specifically it includes the management of the grants and contributions programs for youth, working age adults, employers, seniors, persons with disabilities, aboriginal people, and Official language minority communities. This also includes such programs as Youth Programs; National Homelessness Partnering Strategy, Aboriginal Programs, Workplace Skills Strategy, New Horizons for Seniors Program, Labour Market Information, Work Sharing Program, Temporary Foreign Worker Program and other special and emerging programs such as the EcoAUTO program. Program Delivery is responsible for the delivery and management of the HRSDC / SCI programs and services to citizens in accordance with the established service standards. Delivery processes occur at the Regional, local and community levels as well as within either a defined service area or specified territory. The portfolio of programs and services targets youth, working age adults, seniors, Aboriginal peoples, official languages minority communities and persons employed through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program. [The Position The Director, Program Delivery provides Regional leadership for the delivery and management of the comprehensive suite of Government programs and services designed or adapted to be appropriate to the Regional settings. Factors that require consideration include: population concentrations, the specific needs of targeted program and service clients, the expectations of communities, resource constraints (i.e. financial, human and time), geographic considerations and the availability of technology to deliver programs and services and the capacity and capability of intended recipients to use such technology. The Director manages the on-going assessment of the organization structure to identify opportunities to effect changes that enhance Director, Program Delivery LMSDP Page 2 of 5
| oe Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada the timeliness and effectiveness of program and services delivery and management and, more broadly, that enhance service excellence. The Director, Program Delivery defines, interprets and articulates the operational framework for the delivery and management of the suite of HRSDC / SCI programs and services. The operational framework consists of the legislation, regulations, policies, processes, procedures, standards, guidelines, practices and other factors that describe and prescribe how the labour management and social support programs and services are to be delivered and managed. The framework also provides a reference point for Program Officers who are faced with delivery and management situations that are outside the norm yet appear to fall within the spirit and intent of a program or service. While the specific accountabilities are encapsulated in a later section, the challenges of the position require elaboration. [Challenges] At a very general level and extending across all of the programs managed and delivered within this business stream, there is a special requirement for adaptation and path-finding. Each region has its own social, education and employment characteristics, opportunities and limitations. These further vary widely within regions and demographic groups. Labour issues are widely varied from industrial manufacturing regions to commerce based regions, from urban to rural communities. Seniors support programs such as New Horizons also vary markedly from Urban to Rural environments. Student financial support measures are relatively common across the region but vary in terms of seasonal issues. While the respective Branches of HRSDC establish the policy parameters and envelopes within these programs, the detailed analytical assessments of labour market and special needs of various segments of the labour work force and social groupings is essentially under the relatively independent purview of the Director, Program Delivery LMSDP, as well as assessment of the special social program and community development needs, needs of the aboriginal communities, education support, programs for older workers and persons with disabilities. One of the long standing goals of any of HRSDC s programs is to promote the capacity of individual citizens to become self-sufficient though social development projects. The objectives of Social Development Projects are: to support the development and utilization of effective approaches to address social issues and barriers; to sustain social inclusion for individuals, families and communities; to foster collaboration, partnerships, alliances and networks to address existing and emerging social issues; to recognize and support the ability of not-for-profit organizations to identify and address social development priorities. The Director must collaborate with colleagues and the Executive Director in assessing the various potential Social Development Projects to be funded within the Region The assessment must consider if the project promotes this greater independence, promotes accessibility; builds on active living approaches (not only as ways to avoid disability) in order to enhance quality of life for people aging with a disability, or aging into a disability, and seniors with disabilities; develops inclusive communities through innovative tools, best practices and models of full participation and integration, including overcoming fear and stigmatization of disability; does it bring together youth/student organizations to improve inclusion and opportunities for youth to achieve equality? This sort of social intervention analysis requires contributions to the most sophisticated causative factor identification, risk-assessment, and optimization principles to discern the most cost effective means and vehicles to achieve the projects goals.

| oe Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada The diversity of social programs and the instruments and program vehicles that may be applied represents an integration of major public initiatives of many earlier departments and their programs, now bundled together under the mantle of LMSDP. This vast collection of program initiatives to which LMSDP employees direct funding, grants, contributions and partnership arrangements to influence the labour market and to activate social support mechanisms across the region, requires an understanding in the field of social animation and intervention theory and practice, as well as the managerial and leadership capacity to lead teams toward common cause and result. The further level of challenge within the foregoing is in being aware of such a flux of rapidly changing external influences within the designated regional assignment such as economic trends, labour market variances, unemployment variances; socio-economic trends, demographics and aging population, urbanization, immigration, education, poverty, visible minorities; along with contextual changes such as technological advancements, Government Priorities, Central Agency requirements such as the Management Accountability Framework, and the Federal Accountability Act. Interrelationships and Authority The Director works with colleagues and the Executive Director as well as staff within the Strategic Services business stream to establish and direct the implementation of a performance measurement framework that details standards for delivery of services and how the process will function with the key tasks being monitoring, evaluation and reporting processes. The Director must work closely with Citizen Service, Processing and Payment Services and Integrity Services to support the Service Canada Initiative vision to meet the social needs of citizens and communities. Further, the Director contributes to adapting and establishing special programs that have been developed and tested in other regional Centre s of Specialization [e.g. Home Care workers programs, Temporary and Foreign Worker program]. The Director provides regional leadership for subordinate management positions, in developing new and ongoing working relationships and in providing for preliminary negotiations of grants and contributions agreements, partnership arrangements, cooperation and capacity building, and coordination of program delivery with other agencies and jurisdictions. Through these contacts and activities, the Director aligns the Labour Market and Social Development Programs delivery to ensure that Human Resources Skills and Development Canada and Service Canada Initiative s strategic priorities are supported. The Director maintains strong linkages, information/intelligence channels, and networks with the regional and NHQ senior directors and managers to contribute to program developments. DIMENSIONS The O&M for the designated Director Program Delivery structures and Director positions exceed $3.5 million [i.e. approximately 55 FTEs]. SPECIFIC ACCOUNTABILITIES I.

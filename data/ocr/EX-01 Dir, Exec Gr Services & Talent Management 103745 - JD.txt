NATURE AND SCOPE NATURE ET PORTEE DES FONCTIONS ESDC's mission is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and improving Canadians quality of life by delivering a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives. ESDC is responsible for the policy agenda and service delivery context for the achievement of this mission to strengthen the social foundations of the country. ESDC is mandated to provide a leadership role and focal point for federal social, labour market and economic programs and activities related to the development of Canada s human capital. HRSB supports the Department's business and mandate by providing workforce and workplace policies, programs and services that help ensure that employees are engaged in their work, managers are providing leadership that fosters creativity and innovation, and the Department, as a whole, has the workforce capacity it needs to continuously evolve and adapt to new priorities and changing needs of Canadians. It is within this context that the Director, Executive Services and Talent Management provides strategic advice and services to the Deputy Minister in fulfilling his/her responsibilities and accountabilities, and delegated authority in the management of the second largest EX community in the Federal Government in the areas of workforce planning, staffing and recruitment, official languages, talent management, performance management, succession planning; leadership development and employment equity. The Division also manages Executive and non-executive talent management and performance management programs for the Department. The Director provides authoritative strategic advice and recommendations to the ADM of HR, departmental ADMs, the DM and COO on strategies, plans and initiatives, including analyses of trends, risk assessments and issues identification/resolution; implements performance measures and conducts program monitoring, evaluation and reporting; influences the adoption of new HR policies, programs, processes and practices within the department; and contributes to government wide HR directions and objectives, through dialogue and participation on departmental and interdepartmental working groups/committees pertaining to issues affecting the executive community. The incumbent plays a critical role in developing an enterprise-wide sustainable approach to executive workforce management and leadership development for the executive cadre across the department, and in developing a new talent management framework to support and advance the Department's HR vision and strategy and its program priorities. While the policy and program strategies must conform to legislation and various central agency directives, the Director is expected to create innovative approaches to bridging the old with the new, integrating centrally driven initiatives and positioning the Department s unique management stamp on leadership development and talent management initiatives and executive resourcing. The changing demographics of the workforce, in particular the aging federal executive cadre and the changing nature of government service delivery add a dimension of complexity to the work. The Director is required to make use of seasoned diplomatic skills to persuade and influence stakeholders and colleagues; to successfully articulate why change is needed and why it must happen within the planned timeframe, and ultimately, to secure acceptance and cooperation. The incumbent will also play a lead role in the implementation of key business initiatives as assigned by the ADM related to talent management, which requires making strategic linkages between future HR business orientations and ongoing/transformational work being undertaken within the Department.

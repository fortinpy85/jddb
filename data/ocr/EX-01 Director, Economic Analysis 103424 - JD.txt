NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. The Strategic and Service Policy Branch develops and coordinates policy advice and analysis across the Department. The responsibilities of the Branch include the development of economic, social and service policies, and research activities related to ESDC s mandate. It is also the focal point for portfolio-wide strategic planning and priority setting: analysis. guidance and oversight on service-related issues; the Innovation Lab; program evaluation: Cabinet and regulatory affairs: International and intergovernmental relations: and housing. Within SSPB, the Economic Policy Directorate (EPD) provides strategic research, analysis, and advice on skills development, labour market, Indigenous, and economic issues with a view to promoting a competitive, growing, and inclusive economy. It assesses Canada s current and future labour market and skills needs to help ensure that ESDC s policies and programs are aligned with these needs and develops innovative responses to emerging challenges. The past few years have created unprecedented challenges to labour economists in mapping the way forward in the pandemic and post-pandemic labour markets for the Canadian workforce feeling uncertain about the future. The Director, Economic Analysis is accountable for the analysis of the Canadian labour economics in terms of employment, unemployment, non-standard and precarious work, groups underrepresented in the labour market, immigration, wages and productivity against the Canadian macroeconomic environment (e.g., Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and inflation). These analyses create arich source of information that is used for policy and program 2
development, enabling evidence-based decisions. The incumbent directs the interpretation of data to create and diffuse labour market intelligence for the use of a broad audience, internal and external to the Department and government. The Director oversees the development of evergreen analytical products, which allows departmental policy users and other stakeholders to access up to date data and analysis to inform policiy and program decisions. The incumbent directs the preparation of labour market backgrounders for the use of policy and program designers to understand how certain megatrends (e.g., population aging, theological changes, ect.) or economic shocks (e.g., COVID-I9 pandemic; high inflation) are impacting underrepresented groups and how policy initiatives can target and remedy such trends. The incumbent directs the development of Canada s labour market assessment publication that includes charts and data on economic and labour market growth and projections from various external and internal sources, by industry, by province and by underrepresented groups, among others. The Director engages with statistical specialists at Statistics Canada, OECD and Canadian think tanks to share data and develop insights into trends and their impact on the Canadian labour market and economy. The Director also engages with economic experts from Global Affairs Canada (GAC), Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), Finance Canada, Statistics Canada, international academics working in labour economics, as well as Canadian and international private research organizations. The Director leads analysis of pandemic impacts on the labour economy and also directs analysis of re-emerging pre-pandemic conditions to ensure that current mega-trends are not dismissed as solely pandemic-related. One issue of particular interest to the Department is precarious employment, which may include poor quality jobs, some forms of part-time, self- employment, and many other elements, such as low pay and no benefits. The Director works with Statistics Canada on the development of a universal definition of precarious work, examining potential measures and data sources to reveal the scope of precarious employment in Canada, to scope needs and inform policy and program responses. The Director provides expert advice and briefing on labour economics across the Department, ensuring branches are provided with briefings and advice that are relevant to their needs. As the labour economics subject matter expert, the incumbent plays a challenge role on programming, provides clarity on the short to long-term effect on the Canadian labour market of certain programs and offers alternate approaches to incentivize Canadian workers. The Director provides advice and analyses on labour economics issues to other government departments, for example, to IRCC in terms of immigration levels, the Canadian labour market and how various scenarios will play out in the short and long terms. The Director also provides advice to GAC on the labour economics implications of free trade agreements (FTAs) and provides recommendations on negotiating positions that involve labour economics to avoid unintended outcomes from FTAs. The incumbent provides advice to ISED on the macroeconomic impacts of their microeconomic and policies and programs. The Director oversees the production of briefing notes, presentations, and reports for ESDC Ministers and senior executives which examine and clarify a broad range of labour market and macroeconomic trends. Products include information on economic monitoring, employment, unemployment, non-standard and precarious work, groups underrepresented in the labour market, immigration, wages and productivity. The Ministers and senior staff rely on the 3
Director's acute understanding of Canadian and international economic issues and their interplay with the Canadian labour economy, such that there is no hesitation in citing the analyses to Parliament and the public. The Director leads by example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining the necessary professional expertise. The incumbent must demonstrate strong operational/organizational skills, sound judgment, and operating environment acumen, and manage allocated resources with probity.

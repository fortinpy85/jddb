The position is the lead official for HRDC s Children s portfolio and has an impact on all departmental program activities and expenditures related to children s and family programming. Similarly, as the lead federal official for the NCB, the position guides the development of the federal-provincial/territorial strategic orientations and policy and program delivery frameworks and oversees the implementation of the initiative and, as such, impacts on the NCB s program budget. NATURE AND SCOPE The recent Social Union agreement is the umbrella under which governments will concentrate their efforts to renew, modernize and harmonize Canadian social policy. It focuses on the Pan-Canadian dimension of health and social policy systems, the linkages between the social and economic unions, and the recognition that reform is best achieved through the collaborative efforts of the Government of Canada and the provinces and territories. The issues of children s and families social status and their relationship to their social and economic well-being, and employment potential, are major areas of preoccupation of the Social Union. There is a strong obligation on the federal government to assume Pan-Canadian leadership and to develop the collaborative relationships and partnerships with provincial and territorial governments to effectively deal with these issues and establish a viable, national social services infrastructure. At the First Ministers Meeting in I996, the Prime Minister and Premiers made tackling child poverty a collective priority. Federal, provincial and territorial governments across Canada collaborated, under HRDC s leadership, in the development of the National Child Benefit (NCB). The issues of child poverty and children living at risk have continued to gain support and momentum among all levels of government as well as a strong profile among the general public, the media and academic, think-tank and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in this area of public policy. The expectations are high for federal leadership at the national level and for support to the provinces/territories in order for all levels of government to effectively manage these issues. For this reason, there is considerable pressure for the federal Budget for 2OOO to provide the strategic federal direction and national funding to enable all governments to focus their effort and work collaboratively on addressing these issues. The federal resolve to deal with these issues was demonstrated in the last two Speeches from the Throne, and the federal government has increased its support and funding for the Canada Child Tax Benefit (i.e., funding is $I.7 Billion in I998). In I997, the federal, provincial and territorial Council on Social Policy Renewal requested that health and social service ministries begin to explore possibilities for coordination towards the National Children's Agenda (NCA), and agreed to fast track the work on the agenda through the Ministerial Council. Again, HRDC provided the national leadership to broker and negotiate agreement of the strategic vision for the NCA with all involved provinces and territories.
Within this context, the Director, Children s Policy is responsible for: developing integrated departmental, federal and national social development policy frameworks and strategic initiatives in the context of current socio-economic conditions; directing the identification and analysis of major challenges for Canada's strategic frameworks in these areas of public policy; and managing the NCA and the NCB, which is the largest social development program in the last I5 years in terms of budget and status in Canada. The incumbent is also responsible for leading the development of strategic links and partnership or collaborative arrangements with federal, provincial and territorial levels of government; leading the federal response to children s and family issues, which are among the highest profile issues in the recent Social Union Agreement: driving forward on Cabinet's, the Minister's and HRDC' s children's and family priorities; and ensuring strong relationships with the federal family of departments involved in the portfolio s national sphere of influence. A guiding consideration for the Director is the need to ensure the linkage of the Children s portfolio s strategic social policy development activity and focus with the intent and federal obligations stemming from the recent Social Union agreement. This is essential to ensure consistency with this overarching framework and the promotion and advancement of federal priorities and commitments made in the Social Union agreement. The major challenge for the Director is to manage the overall strategic priority setting and strategic policy development activities for the Children s Social Policy portfolio. The policy focus is on the need to address the concerns of children and their families living at risk, or in poverty, and on enhancing their economic, social and employment well-being and potential. A major objective is to realize these goals while developing more cost-effective and resource-efficient integrated policy processes and delivery systems with partners, and replacing current, costly social support programs and processes with more fiscally responsible and socially valuable models. The range of policy issues for which the Director must direct research and analysis is extensive and complex. Major areas include: regional and national income levels with particular emphasis on the affect of poverty on children; social conditions such as children of single parents living at or near the poverty line, and other factors affecting child poverty; appropriate income support models; community based services required to alleviate the impact of poverty on children; the level of support required versus funding and funding mechanisms; national and provincial tax treatment of families at or below the poverty level; shared governance and accountability models; taxation levels and tax credit mechanisms; national and provincial tax structure changes; the effect of tax credits on income levels of the poor: and aboriginal children. Complicating the development of strategic policy initiatives to address these issues is the wide range of external clients, stakeholders and partners (e.g., MPs, provincial/territorial agencies, national and regional NGOs, academic and research institutions, Aboriginal associations, advocacy groups, etc.) who have widely varying policy and funding positions and strategic priorities concerning what issues require action, and the type of action or 4
intervention to deal with them. The range of issues and of external participants in the portfolio requires the Director to direct a strong environmental scanning capacity and develop authoritative knowledge and consultative networks with major clients, stakeholders and partners. This primarily includes the Regions and corporate Branches of HRDC, the provinces/territories and national organizations involved in children and family policy application and program delivery. This allows the incumbent to identify emerging issues, trends and developments that will require attention, establish a watching brief, if required, or to develop a required response strategy and position from HRDC and the federal government. It also ensures effective, Ongoing consultation with external clients, stakeholders and partners so that their evolving policy priorities, expectations and positions can be factored into the policy analysis and development process, and provides the capacity to fully engage these players in policy inititiaves or in dealing with policy issues. The Director faces a major challenge in developing short-term as well as long-term perspectives in order to develop the strategic priorities and comprehensive strategy policy approaches that will bring together and gain consensus among an array of clients, stakeholders and partners with highly different views and interests. The Director must lead the process to develop a common understanding on issues and on the vision that will allow ail parties to support or collaborate in research, analysis and policy development activities. The Director ensures that the interaction with external clients, stakeholders and partners emphasizes transparent and open communications. The main principles guiding the consultative processes include building consensus through negotiations and discussions, mutual respect and a spirit of cooperation. The Director directs the review of the various policy options produced by the Division, or proposed by external clients, stakeholders and partners, and of their level of acceptability in terms of meaningful social and income support to children and families in need, and their affect in alleviating child poverty. This often involves developing, or assessing proposed, economic models of various support systems and predicting their impact on low income families, including income support levels using various levels of tax credit. These options are then discussed with all involved federal, provincial/territorial departments and agencies and with other major stakeholders to determine their relevance and suitability and impact on existing social services and systems or other governance systems. The total policy development process involves the preparation and dissemination of draft position papers to all involved parties and extensive leadership, consultation and negotiation activities by the Director to advocate federal positions and gain required agreements with, and between, all levels of government, and the acceptance and support of key external clients, stakeholders and partners. The Director is also responsible for developing all strategies and actions to submit proposed policy initiatives and fina! policy positions for the approval of the central agencies and Cabinet and for overseeing the legislative process to table Bills and gain Parliamentary approval. A)
A key aspect of the policy development process is for the Director to ensure the fiscal responsibility and value-added nature of the various policy initiatives. The incumbent also guides the development of policies so that they move forward in reducing overlap and duplication between governments and clarify how governments will work together in the design, development and subsequent implementation of policies and programs for children s and family issues across Canada. The current NCA and NCB are examples of initiatives that have been produced through this process. The NCA is a major policy initiative and provides the Director with a springboard to introduce future children s and families social policy initiatives and with a catalyst to draw partners together (federal, provincial and territorial governments, community groups, professionals, business, volunteers and families) to enhance mutual actions concerning the Children s portfolio. The NCA includes collective policy priorities as well as potential joint federal, provincial and territorial initiatives to underpin these policy directions (e.g., continuing to strengthen income security, efforts to optimize early child development). The Director uses the NCA to futher HRDC s startegic policy priorities and to complement other inititiaves that fall outside its parameters. A critical responsibility for the Director is the policy coordination and oversight role concerning the implementation of the NCB. This is the largest federal social initiative in the last I5 years and is composed of two main elements: increased federal benefits for families with net incomes below $26,OOO, through the Canada Child Tax Benefit, and provincial and territorial reinvestments in services and benefits such as daycare, drug and/or dental plans or increased income benefits for Canadian families and their children. The Director discharges the lead federal role for the coordination of all policy development and the provision of policy advice and interpretations concerning the NCB to all OGDs, involved provinces/territories and other major stakeholders. The incumbent also guides the implementation of Phase | and II of this major initiative which involve a total of $I.7 billion in funding. This is a complex and complicated responsibility given the range of government organizations and NGOs involved in this program and the need to gain PCO approval on policy issues, and agreement from the Department of Finance, which is responsible for the fiscal aspects and legislation governing this initiative, and from Revenue Canada, which is the federal service provider. The Director plays the lead federal role in the development of integrated departmental, federal and national Governance and Accountability policy frameworks for the NCB that commit all federal, provincial and territorial governments to the objectives, principles and partnership surrounding the NCB, including public accountability and reporting. Primary objectives of this concept are to emphasize the accountability of all involved levels of government to the Canadian public for the effectiveness of the program delivery and to introduce shared reporting to the public on progress and adherence to milestones and deliverables. 6
Tne incumbent is now involved in assessing the success and results achieved by Phases | and || of the NCB and in conducting wide ranging consultations to determine the support for proceeding to a Phase Ill. This requires viable and authoritative research and analytical methodologies, tools and techniques so as to present sound information to partners and stakeholders, including the Auditor General and Parliamentary Committees, that will accurately depict the program's implementation and associated costs and benefits. It is believed that current partners and key stakeholders and clients will want an expansion of the current NCB. It is the incumbent's responsibility to gain national consensus on strategic priorities and on service delivery and public accountability and reporting frameworks, and to develop and manage the strategies and processes to obtain needed central agency and Cabinet approvals. The NCB is seen by all levels of government as a positive model to guide future initiatives under the Social Union, given the collaborative partnership between the Government of Canada and provincial/territorial governments that has characterized its development. Other features of the NCB that are believed to be leading-edge machinery of government processes and mechanisms include the concepts and practices concerning shared public accountability and reporting frameworks. The Director in promoting and realizing Cabinet's, the Minister's and HRDC s strategic priorities and policy initiatives for the Children s portfolio chairs intra- and interdepartmental, HRDC-client/stakeholder/partner and federal-provincial/territorial steering committees on policy issues. The incumbent is also responsible for leading a broad-based, multi-sectoral approach with these parties to develop strategic links for the development of a common understanding and a national consensus on the strategic Priorities and initiatives required for the national Children s social policy portfolio. This involves conceiving, selecting and implementing the best strategic approaches to deal with federal, provincial and territorial roles and responsibilities, and cobbling the first steps leading to the development of a national policy infrastructure for Canada s social services sector. This intra-/interdepartmental, intergovernmental and federal- client/stakeholder/partner coordination is key to the development of required horizontal consensus in this critical area of public policy. The Director leads, often as the delegate of the DG, ADM, DM and Minister, or under authority assigned by PCO, wide-ranging negotiations and consultations with central agencies and OGDs (e.g., PCO, Department of Finance, Revenue Canada, INAC, Health Canada), provincial and territorial agencies, Aboriginal organizations, academics, NGOs, research institutes, think tanks, etc., all of which have their own agendas and positions on Children s policy issues and initiatives. The incumbent is accountable in these dealings and representational activities for acting as the federal government catalyst, lead federal policy coordinator, and expert advisor on the assigned policy issues. The incumbent negotiates agreements in principle with the central agencies and OGDs, particularly PCO, the Department of Finance and Revenue Canada, and with provincial social services and revenue departments on major issues such as their support for a system of tax credits for children s benefits. In certain cases the Director enters into agreements and joint ventures
with external organizations to determine the feasibility and rea! impact of policy proposals in order to ensure the viability of the approach and to test social, economic and cost models and projections. The Director conducts, contracts for and facilitates research related to children s and family strategic social policy development issues and initiatives. This is essential to ensure the viability, validity and relevance of the data and information upon which policy priorities and policy development initiatives, as well as briefing notes and advisory services, are Based. The incumbent works with the Applied Research Directorate on compiex and varied socio- economic data, trends and developments that lead to the identification and analysis of major challenges for federal/HRDC children s social policy. This research is also crucial as it underpins the ongoing development of the NCA, the conduct of new policy initiatives (such as Early Years) and the resulting national policy and program frameworks and social sector infrastructure. The incumbent directs the review and analysis of all research and studies and the interpretation of their results to provide senior management and the Minister with an assessment of current events having an impact on these complex, sensitive and political issues. He/she also contracts for major strategic policy studies to be conducted by the Applied Research Directorate, academics, economists, think tanks and other authorities, including the definition of terms of reference, expertise required, schedules and target dates. The Director oversees the establishment of the portfolio s corporate knowledge and information base to support its policy analysis and development priorities. This includes developing knowledge and information sharing agreements with the provinces, other domestic, foreign and international sources, and social/academic organizations. The Director must ensure that policy positions developed within the Division, or through consultative or collaborative processes, are based on relevant and valid information that has been produced by sound conceptual theories, models and practices and rigorous analytical methodologies Given the government's and HRDC's priority for extensive consultation with clients, stakeholders and partners on policy development, and the need for a convergence of social and economic policy, many of the policy initiatives lead by the Director will involve multi-disciplinary intra- and inter-departmental, intergovernmental and federal-client group Task Forces or Committees. The incumbent will usually Jead, or play a major role for, such initiatives given HRDC's dominance in this area of Canadian public policy. These consultative initiatives pose a major challenge to the Director in order to: ead them in such a way as to gain agreement on the approach to be followed and on the scope and purpose of the initiative; advocate the HRDC/federa! position; identify problem areas requiring special! study or the strategically planned intervention of senior and Executive management of HRDC; and negotiate or develop strategies to gain a consensus on 8
feasible and effective policy positions. The Director is HRDC's, and in many cases the federal government's, recognized senior corporate official for Children s policy development and related activities. As such, the incumbent plays a significant advisory role with the Minister, DM, ADM, DG and other senior management, including addressing tssues at the Deputy Minister's Daily Operations Meeting and at the Management Board. In order to perform these services, the Director must ensure the functioning of an ongoing creative and central policy formulation focus to provide the Minister, senior management, and the federal government with significant, realistic, and responsive strategies and innovative policy options on how HRDC can best focus the department's and national effort and resource expenditures. Attainment of this objective is highly complicated given the intricate and interrelated issues, which involve a wide range of players. The Director directs the preparation of submissions to the central agencies, Memoranda to Cabinet and legislative submissions for approval in Parliament related to new and amended policy positions for the portfolio. The incumbent also plays a key advisory role in assisting HRDC's corporate Branches and Regions, OGDs, the provinces and other partners make necessary changes in service and program delivery that are required due to new policy initiatives. The Director is a senior member of the DG's Directorate Management Committee and as such makes a significant contribution to the formulation of the Directorate s culture, philosophy, strategic and business priorities, and overarching program policy and delivery, performance measurement and accountability frameworks. The incumbent is responsible for all planning, program implementation, monitoring and evaluation for the Division so as to attain the strategic priorities of HRDC s Vision statement and of senior management, and to optimize the performance of HRDC s Children s portfolio. The Director develops and maintains a professional and supportive work environment for the Division that encourages empowerment and the continuous development of managers and staff and provides opportunities for growth.

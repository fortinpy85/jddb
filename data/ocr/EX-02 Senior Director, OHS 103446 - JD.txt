NATURE AND SCOPE Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) was created on February 6, 2OO6 as part of the Government's initiative to streamline management of the array of programs that encompasses the new Department's mandate and as part of a larger initiative to streamline Cabinet. Under the leadership of the Deputy Minister of HRSDC, the new department, and its portfolio partners (Service Canada, CMHC and Labour Program) has been given a broad social and economic mandate which affects every Canadian.

The mission of the Labour Program of HRSDC is to promote a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment that contributes to the social and economic well-being of all Canadians. While the Labour Program works within the HRSDC context, its policy and operational focuses and associated initiatives and activities operate in a largely separate and distinct fashion from those of the main priorities and programs of HRSDC.
Human Resources and Social Development Canada The Labour Program administers Parts |, II and Ill of the Canada Labour Code (CLC). It also administers the Non-Smokers Health Act (NSHA), the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA), the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act (MSCA), the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act and the Employment Equity Act as well as the Federal Contractors Program. Additionally, Fire Protection Services provide for the protection from fire hazards of federal properties and their occupants by administering and enforcing Treasury Board policies, as well as related codes and standards. The primary clientele of the Labour Program are federal jurisdiction employers, employees and unions in key sectors of the economy. These sectors include: e Transportation (airlines, rail, inter-provincial trucking, ports and airports); e The post office and courier companies; e Communications (broadcasters, cable companies, telecom companies, Internet providers): e The banking, grain and nuclear industries; e Federal Crown corporations, federal departments and agencies (for occupational health and safety and fire prevention purposes); e Awide range of companies who have major contracts with the federal government (for employment equity purposes); and e Aboriginal governments, their employees, Aboriginal communities, and certain Aboriginal undertakings.

These changes in the federal workplace bring with them an increased responsibility for ensuring compliance to national standards, with a corresponding need for new, more EX-O2 Senior Director, OHS Page 4/II Date: 2OO7-II-OI

Within this context, the Senior Director develops the national strategic direction for OHS programs and provides strong functional direction to five (5) regional offices. The Senior Director provides leadership in the development of a national strategic framework and operational policies, standards and practices for administering OHS standards on behalf of the Government of Canada. This includes the development of innovative approaches to integrated national-regional program delivery which is focused on consistent quality services to individuals. The incumbent develops planning and control mechanisms for managing the Directorate s mandate of ensuring fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment that I's responsive to the government's SOciO-economic agenda and contributes to the social and economic well-being of Canadians. The incumbent is responsible for the planning, development and application of business plans, operational budgets and communications strategies to enhance program performance in the context of the new management model. The Senior Director provides leadership and direction in the development of OHS program policy review frameworks, the analysis of the needs of the new economy and the development of program policy and legislative changes. As OHS regulations prescribe standards and procedures to be followed by both employers and employees to ensure health and safety in the workplace, a major challenge for the Senior Director is the requirement to consider a number of competing values and interests from a variety of interested parties including employer organizations such as the Canadian Bankers Association and employee organizations such as the Canadian Labour Congress that must be accommodated when developing or recommending policy changes, including the rights of employers and workers in the federal jurisdiction. This requires the Senior Director to ensure a balance between social values and economic realities, as well as ensuring that linkages between Part II and Ill of the Canada Labour Code (CLC) are considered in the development of new policy directions. The Senior Director is responsible for directing the development and implementation of effective, national OHS standards.

Human Resources and Social Development Canada The Senior Director directs the development of document and tools to help employers and employees meet their obligations under the Canada Labour Code (CLC), Part Il. For example, the Code prescribes the role of health and safety committees, the roles and responsibilities of health and safety officers, and procedures determining whether a danger exists when a refusal to work arises. The Senior Director therefore provides expert advice and ensures the provision of consultative services to assist employers and employees In organizing, implementing and monitoring OHS programs in the workplace. Advice and guidance is also provided on an on-going basis to regional officers involved in implementing and monitoring the program.

Another challenge relates to the implementation of regulations. Substantive changes were made to Part Il of the Canada Labour Code (CLC) in 2OOO necessitating further development and modifications to the regulatory regime. The Hazard Prevention Program Regulation, recently enacted, supports a method of compliance which empowers both the employer and employees with the ability to set out corrective measures before they create a problem. It is essential that the regulatory regime keep pace with societal norms. With the transition from the concept/development phase to the actual implementation of new or modified regulation, it is imperative that the Senior Director works closely with the Director General, Compliance and Regional Operations to design and develop a strategy anda methodology platform for compliance in order to ensure the successful implementation of the legislation. As with this regulation, the Senior Director will be challenged in ensuring that OHS acts, regulations, and practices keep pace the changing world of work, the rapid pace technological advancements, and changing societal norms. Monitoring workplaces to ensure compliance with the Code presents a number of challenges. The measures used allow for a graduated response and present a clear preference for resolving situations of non-compliance through voluntary action. Where compliance is not achieved voluntarily, a legally binding direction can be issued which could EX-O2 - Senior Director, OHS Page 6/II Date: 2OO7-II-OI
Human Resources and Social Development Canada lead to prosecution. While directions are issues on a case specific basis they do have a precedent setting role federally and provincially. The financial obligations imposed upon non-compliant employers could reach in the millions of dollars. Non-compliance with a regulation could cost the lives of workers. The Senior Director must ensure a structured approach which is falr, foreseeable and nationally consistent.

NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Lead by four Ministers and six Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Within the Department, the Learning Branch helps make post-secondary education and apprenticeship training more affordable and accessible to all Canadians. The Branch helps families save early for their children s post-secondary education through education savings benefits. It also provides grants and loans and repayment assistance to students and apprentices in need and by providing non-financial support aimed at helping students succeed in their studies and transition to post-secondary education and/or the labour market. The major programs managed by the Branch are the Canada Student Loans Program, the Canada Education Savings Program( CESP), Supports for Student Learning Program, as well as the Global Skills Opportunity program, funded by ESDC and administered jointly by Colleges and Institutes Canada and Universities Canada. Within CESP and linked to Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) are additional education savings benefits, specifically the Canada Learning Bond (CLB) and the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG). Budget 2O24 announced enhancements to the CLB, transitioning the current need-to-apply program delivery model to an automatic enrolment approach. This model involves establishing a contractual arrangement with one of CESP s 85 financial industry partners, as well as engaging with other government departments, such as CRA, Indigenous organizations, key academics and policy stakeholders. In this context the Executive Director is accountable for leading the development of legislative, regulatory and operational policy changes that provide authorities and governance of the changes to the CESP. Changes of this nature present an intellectual and operational challenge, in that existing CLB statutes are predicated on sections of the Canada Education Savings Act, S.C. 2OO4 which have been unchanged since 2OO4. In addition to the development of amendments that represent a clear departure from the previous Act, the Executive Director must ensure that amendments dealing with CLB do not affect the integrity of sections that stand. The incumbent consults with partners and stakeholders both internal and external to government to obtain their views and insights on the changes and works with legislative drafters to ensure clarity of intent and wording. Overall, the Executive Director is responsible for the multiple Orders in Council and Coming into Force for the legislative and regulatory changes. The Executive Director oversees the development of associated regulations, and program and operational policies to provide guidance on the application and interpretation of the amendments. The incumbent undertakes in-depth analysis of the issues and decisions that must be made in advancing legislative and regulatory change and identifies overlap or contradictory positions between existing legislation and amendments. Further, the Executive Sr Dir, Prg Design Partnership Page 3 of 7 July 22, 2O24
Director provides assessments and strategic advice to the Director General and the ADM on the impacts of legislative and policy changes on CESP and its stakeholders. The Executive Director consults extensively and develops strong relationships with key stakeholders to strengthen program relationships and promote and advance national CESP priorities and strategic agendas. The incumbent develops innovative consultative mechanisms with the Directorate s key partners and stakeholders to gain their input into the overall strategic planning framework, to identify critical positions and requirements, and to ensure they are effectively considered and integrated in program design and delivery initiatives. As well, the Executive Director establishes close working relationships with Indigenous organizations and Indigenous serving organizations to increase awareness and understanding of what the CESP offers, and available supports in an effort to bring Indigenous student enrolment in post- secondary schools closer to the national average. The major amendment to the Act is the shift from need-to-apply program model to auto- enrolment in the RESP and associated CLB. This shift requires the creation of a contractual arrangement with one of the financial institutions partners. The Executive Director is accountable for the development of the overall MPIB government project (totaling about $2OM over four years) and its related procurement approach and all processes associated with it. The Project includes a range of dependencies with Service Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency. The incumbent directs and oversees the Project process in its entirety from the development and publication of a Request for Information to gauge interest and capacity among the financial industry partners to the subsequent Request for Proposals, receipt of bids, their evaluation and negotiation of terms and conditions. The number of variables, the technical and governance requirements of the new model, the need to ensure the delivery of the new model complies with amended Act and the privacy concerns around the personal information of participants creates a formidable challenge for the Executive Director. This role will include management of a temporary team to manage the RFI/RFP process with a total contracting value of $3.5M/3 years and S6OO in ongoing costs The actual management of such a large project is as challenging as its start-up. The project is expected to take approximately 4 years and the size of the investment, $I6OM in CLB annual incremental statutory payments, requires the departmental gating model. All of these activities must take place within the parameters of ESDC s Project Management Framework. The Executive Director will be responsible (along with the existing project team) to provide regular reports and briefings on project status and issues to the Major Project Investment Board. The Executive Director is responsible for leading the development of the Treasury Board submission and seeks TBS approval after gate 2 has been reached. Once the contract is awarded and implemented, the incumbent is accountable for managing the contract for its duration of a minimum of five years and monitoring its administration to ensure the terms and conditions are fulfilled. Where issues arise, the Executive Director is mandated to represent the Branch in dealing with corporate officials of the financial institution and exercises latitude in finding solutions. The Senior Director is accountable for policy and economic research in collaboration with other policy centres to identify and analyze trends, participation rates, issues among the participants and under-represented Canadians, and program impacts. In addition to providing data for analysis and reporting, research stimulates innovative thinking in terms of how data can be used Sr Dir, Prg Design Partnership Page 4 of 7 July 22, 2O24
for creative purposes. The incumbent oversees the development of innovative applications and research into methodologies such as harnessing artificial intelligence and proactive communications that could raise awareness of the advantages of enrolment as well as increasing enrolment itself. The Executive Director oversees the development and dissemination of a robust communication, outreach and engagement strategy, including advertising campaigns and promotional events. The strategies target families from under-represented groups, as research shows that parents informed about the CLB and CESG are more likely to save for their children s PSE. The Executive Director leads the development and delivery of outreach activities to promote the CESP including managing the CESP mailing strategy to CLB-eligible families and associated multi year print contract, developing marketing vehicles in collaboration with key partners and stakeholders and corporate communications to successfully convey strategic messages. The incumbent also directs the activities of the Service to Canadians Network through Service Canada to raise awareness of the CLB and the additional CESG as well as encouraging greater participation in these programs. The Executive Director represents the Directorate and the Branch in meetings and consultation fora with a host of clients, stakeholders and partners. These include the provinces, territories, financial institutions, financial industry associations, ESDC Branches and Programs, and central agencies, such as Privy Council Office, Finance, and Treasury Board Secretariat. The incumbent forms networks in Canada Revenue Agency, Indigenous Services Canada, as well as a wide range of public, private and NGO networks, and advocacy groups. The Executive Director is responsible for the development of Cabinet/Parliamentary documentation, background papers and briefing notes, and provides authoritative advice on the management of a number of interrelated program issues, such as the policy implications of activities and adjustments to both the CLB and CESG, and asset-based social policy. The Executive Director is expected to react within short time frames and analyze situations in a rigorous and systematic way. The Executive Director leads by example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining professional expertise. The incumbent is a member of the CESP Management Committee and influences decisions on policies, programs, and investments. The Executive Director must demonstrate strong management and operational skills, sound judgement and operating environment acumen, and manages allocated resources prudently.

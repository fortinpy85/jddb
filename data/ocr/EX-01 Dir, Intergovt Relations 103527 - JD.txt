. 4 program development, and reaching out to Canadians to engage citizens on, build awareness of and identify consensus on disability issues. Disability is an issue that touches many, and yet citizens in general are unaware of the challenges and solutions available to improve the outcomes, participation and inclusion of people with disabilities. Twelve percent of the Canadian population (about 3.6 million people) lives with at least one form of disability and about 75% of Canadians know someone with a disability. Disability rates increase with age (3.3% of children, I4.6% of adults and 4O.5% of seniors). so that with the ageing of the population, it is projected that there will be between 5.6 million and 6.I million people with disabilities by 2O26, about . I6% of the population. At the same time, Canada is not fully benefiting from the : employment potential, skills and talents of people with disabilities {I HAVE ASEKD FOR UPDATED INFORMATION]: In 2OO2, employment rates were only 48.7% for adults with disabilities, compared to xx% for those without; o Amongst people with disabilities who are not participating in the labour market, 28 % indicate that it is environmental barriers - not their disability that prevent them from working. o Median earnings of working age people with disabilities are I7% lower than tor peers without disabilities. o Nine out of ten people with disabilities necd some type of support or : service in their daily lives, and about half do not have their needs met: the level of unmet need is particularly high amongst those with severe or very severe conditions. The disability community in Canada is visible, and belicves that progress is slow on this file. The community has built a relationship with the Government of Canada and provincial governments over time, where individuals regularly request the intervention of the Minister and the Prime Minister in their cases. Issues are framed on the principles of human rights, equality and advocacy. It is critical that issues be anticipated and managed carefully and sensitively and that the Department continually solicit the involvement of national and regional organizations and individuals, hear their stories, engage them in : open dialogue and transparent action on policy and program development and evaluation, and maintain strong communications links. As a member of the ODI Management Team, the Director collaborates in the formulation of the Branch swategic and policy direction, culture, philosophy, business and operational plans and priorities, and performance measurement and accountability frameworks. The Director contributes to leading the development and maintenance of a professional, supportive work environment that cncourages the continuous development of managers/staff and provides opportunities for growth.

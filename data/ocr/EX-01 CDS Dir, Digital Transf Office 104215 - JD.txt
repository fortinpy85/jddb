Director, Digital Transformation Office 2 NATURE AND SCOPE TBS is a key Government of Canada central agency led by the Secretary of the Treasury Board (Deputy Minister). It supports a committee of Ministers (the Treasury Board (TB)) led by the TB President (Minister), which exercises authority over a vast range of issues across the federal public service. It has four principal activities, acting as: the government's Management Board; its Expenditure Manager; the Employer for the Core Public Administration (CPA); and a provider of Regulatory Oversight . With the Secretariat, the Strategic Communications and Ministerial Affairs (SCMA) Sector, led by the Assistant Secretary (A/SEC-OSCMA) is a key organization that provides briefings, correspondence and logistical support for Treasury Board meetings, parliamentary affairs, Cabinet business and dealings with other government departments and non-governmental organizations. SCMA manages and coordinates Treasury Board meetings; coordinates the Secretariat's access to information and privacy activities; and tracks the President's and the Secretary's correspondence, and assists in preparing replies. SCMA is also responsible for developing internal and external communications products and providing services in consultation with subject matter experts (e.g., communications strategies and plans, speeches and speaking notes, scenario notes for ministerial events, media advisories, news releases, questions and answers, and news conferences). It also provides a web presence for the President, the Treasury Board Secretariat and prepares government-wide messages, including messages from the President of the Treasury Board. In addition, SCMA, through the Communications and Federal Identify Policy Centre, develops and implements government-wide policy instruments related to communications and corporate identity, and monitors compliance by government departments and agencies. Furthermore, SCMA, through the Digital Transformation Office, develops and implements government-wide policy instruments and guidance related to the Government of Canada s web presence, and monitors compliance by government departments and agencies. It is within this context that the Director, Digital Transformation Office discharges the following accountabilities. The Environment The GC is a very large, complex organization comprised of many departments and agencies with unique mandates (Health Canada vs. Correctional Services Canada); sizes (Canadian Border Services Agency versus Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency); national (Fisheries and Oceans) and international presence (Global Affairs) with differing work cultures (professional science culture vs. front line service culture). However, they share a common requirement to make their specific programs and services accessible to all Canadians and, in some cases international users. Equally, it is critical that the GC presents a trusted and consistent look and feel, and that the information and services are accessible to all end users. Over the past number of years, the GC has emphasized the need to ensure the content of each departmental web presence is focused on the requirements of the end user. With the advent of digital transformation, it is critical to use its transformative capacity to the maximum extent to improve GC communications with all of its end users. For example, many Canadians now expect information to be interactive to the extent that they can use their mobile device to communicate with the GC and that forms etc. can be completed online. Although a segment of the population, such as those with limited access to the internet or who may be conditioned through long use of other means (e.g. letters, telephone), prefer non-digital means, that segment is decreasing and there is no doubt that at some point in the future the Government of Canada s web presence will become the dominant way Canadians and other end users interact with their government.

Director, Digital Transformation Office 3 Additionally, in fully appreciating understanding the Director's role the digital evolution is just that. It is not a once and done event , but an ongoing process that builds on knowledge and experience as it is gained. All of the Director's accountabilities are contextualized by this ongoing and changing growth process. There is a requirement on the Director's part to remain acutely aware of changes in the digital space and get out in front of it through the development of new approaches, governance, guidelines, etc. as the evolution continues at an ever-increasing pace. Leadership for Today The Director, as the Business Owner's representative leads the Division in developing GC-wide guidance for user experience, information architecture and strategic content management, including developing and supporting a governance structure and identifying key content to ensure it reflects overall GC corporate objectives and client needs and that the GC-wide web presence is in compliance with government-wide and departmental policies and standards on Internet communications, information architecture, user experience and strategic content management (examples are GC Communications and Federal Identity Policy, Official Languages Act, Digital Standards, etc.) and with accessibility standards for persons with disabilities, which the Division champions. The Director further provides evidence to support departments in developing ecurrent, accurate, relevant content, on canada.ca, notably on priorities of the GC. Although every effort is made to work in harmony with departmental clients, the Director must stand firm to protect the end user experience where it is clear that proposed presentation of content would reduce the quality of that experience for all Canadians and International users. Further, the incumbent directs the planning, implementation and evaluation of policies, strategies, procedures, protocols, tools and governance structures applicable to information architecture, user experience, and Web content management for GC web-related initiatives. These guidance tools are used by communications, web, IT teams, departmental stakeholders and other government- wide clients to standardize products and services enabling information sharing and interoperability. These policies, procedures, protocols, tools and governance structures also impact clients government-wide in their planning, business and decision-making processes and strategies relating to the management, on-boarding and migration of web activities. Leadership for the Future The incumbent directly influences the future (short, medium and longer-term) direction that GC- wide web-related initiatives, tools and guidance should take for improved performance in accordance with GC objectives. The incumbent provides expert web management and evaluation services, especially in terms of user experience design, information architecture, strategic content management and usability evaluation, to special committees, working groups, project teams, as well as communications and program delivery units across the GC to improve future user experience and to ensure best value. In addition to the above, the Director supports digital transformation and develops, communicates and implements strategic business transformation and evaluation plans for the GC-wide web presence in consultation with senior management in TBS and other central agencies, as well as Web managers and experts in other TBS branches and other departments and agencies and the Government of Canada s platform owner, Service Canada (SC). The Director's end goal is always to improve end user experience. Project Leadership In carrying out the mandate, the Director oversees and directs interdepartmental, multidisciplinary project teams drawn from the communications, IT and program/service delivery communities May 25, 2O22
Director, Digital Transformation Office 4 across the GC; in developing technical and design solutions to information architecture and web content presentation problems relating to end-user interactions with the GC web presence, with an aim to facilitating and improving Canadian/international users experience in finding information and receiving services from the GC online. In this respect, the incumbent must be very adroit at melding teams from different organizational and professional backgrounds into a cohesive team. Further, there can be significant turnover in these teams and, therefore, the Director must continually bring new resources into the fold and integrate them quickly. Problem Resolution The incumbent leads the resolution of problems in consultation with other stakeholders for the web; analyzes website metrics, feedback responses, surveys and usability testing reports, and proposes solutions to web performance-related issues; develops and presents proposals for GC-wide web presence solution design, content and user interface improvement and optimization to senior management. For example, a department may wish to present its programs and services using high graphic and video content. However, this would result in many Canadians, especially those in isolated areas who do not yet have access to high-speed internet, having slow or virtually no access to that department's information or service. The Director must continue to champion and access to all approach and design until all Canadians have the benefit of full access to the Internet. Special Initiatives Canada.ca is the GC s most direct form of information to Canadians. When major national or international events occur, Canada.ca is a Critical tool for quickly informing Canadians at home and abroad on the impact and best response to these events. Canada.ca is able to provide information quickly thorough the site and will be expected to do so, under the Director's leadership, in circumstances of critical national interest in the future. Research Critical to success, the Director must lead and encourage research of the networked digital public environment to identify user, key audience and stakeholders needs, gain a thorough understanding of the information architecture and user experience models being employed to support the web channel within and beyond the GC. Further, the Director will lead the analysis of research findings to support prioritization of work, policy development, communications and program/service delivery design in relation to TBS and GC-wide goals and objectives for transforming digital channels to improve outcomes for users. Monitoring Contract Performance The incumbent monitors and performs quality control over work performed under contract, to ensure the consultants/companies comply with the terms and conditions of contracts. The incumbent takes decisions under the applicable sections of the Financial Administration Act and the Treasury Board Contracting Regulations and has the authority to direct work to be redone or brought up to contract specifications and quality requirements. While the Director will attempt to resolve these matters in a mutually desirable way, in the event that the contractor is not prepared to follow direction, the Director will prepare and recommend a resolution to senior management. Representation The incumbent represents the SMCA as a sector in meetings with other sectors of TBS and TBS as a department in meetings with other departments and institutions. The incumbent is expected to both openly exchange information, but also to represent TBS's position on relevant matters. At the same time, the Director must be able to exercise strong influencing skills and patience in bringing others onboard. Change is never without resistance in moving from a well-established comfort zone to a new way. The Director must recognize this and build alliances with the front runners to influence the less engaged. At the same time as the Director represents TBS, it must be clear that TBS is a May 25, 2O22
Director, Digital Transformation Office 5 partner in the digital evolution and shares many of the same challenges as others in making the leap. Further, the incumbent must frequently represent ideas and points of view that are not their own, which requires tact, emotional control and persuasion of others. Also, strained circumstances often occur among team members, sectors, other departments, as well as senior managers, due to conflicting management ideas when solutions to problems are presented, which leads to frustration and significant effort in negotiating a resolution. Challenges The Director will be challenged by: Conflicting, multiple, unpredictable priorities, unrealistic client demands, complaints and criticisms, tight deadlines and demanding expectations. The incumbent frequently has no control over the pace of work and must work under extreme pressure. The incumbent must remain in constant contact with the office (through a mobile device) and can be required to work outside normal working hours, frequently on very short notice. The requirement to ensure that clients meet both the policy and practical requirements of their web presence, especially the focus on end users.

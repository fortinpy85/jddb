NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. The Human Resources Services Branch is responsible for developing and delivering people management policies, programs and services for ESDC, Service Canada and the Labour Program. The Branch provides expert advice and recommendations to four Ministers, the Deputy Minister of ESDC, five Deputy Heads, 27 Assistant Deputy Ministers and other senior government officials. HRSB plays a key role in ESDC s management-union relationship, representing ESDC as a member of the National Joint Council. To deliver on this mandate, the Branch focusses on strengthening the workforce for the future, modernizing HR service and program delivery, and enabling a healthy, high-performing and inclusive workplace. One aspect of service improvement, that of disability inclusion, is driven by the 2OI9 Accessible Canada Act, which is meant to ensure a barrier-free Canada. The legislation increases the 2
focus on recruitment, retention and development of a more diverse workforce and a culture of inclusiveness, which in turn requires advanced innovation and agility in learning design, development, and delivery methods to provide accessible training and training in accessibility. In this context, the Director, ESDC Accessibility Office, provides leadership in the research, design, development and implementation of the Department's accessibility plans and strategies. This involves analyzing ESDC s internal and external operating environments through a disability inclusion lens to identify barriers to inclusion for employees and clients, guided by the principle of Nothing Without Us . The Director s horizontal perspective on disability inclusion enables the identification of early opportunities to remove barriers that are less entrenched than others and therefore can be remedied more easily. The Director is accountable for establishing governance structures that assure a coordinated implementation of accessibility improvements across the Department. The identification and review of early opportunities to remove barriers also provides the Director with a basis for consultations with disability communities internal and external to the Department, for both employees and clients. The Director directs the development and distribution of surveys to all ESDC employees and other information-gathering vehicles to solicit concerns, opinions, and ideas from employees with disabilities and without disabilities, including questions regarding the access to and timeliness of accommodation in the workplace, such as accessible work tools. The Director oversees the identification of the principal barriers faced in their workplace, whether physical, architectural, technological or attitudinal. Similarly, the position directs consultation with clients with disabilities, and the identification of the principal barriers that persons with disabilities face in receiving services. Informed by consultations and information-gathering, the Director leads the development, implementation and dissemination of ESDC's accessibility plans that identify, remove and prevent barriers in priority areas, including policies, programs, practices and services. The incumbent ensures that the accessibility strategies and structures are aligned, as needed, with standards set by Accessibility Standards Canada, whose mandate it is to create modern accessibility standards in priority areas, to revise current accessibility standards, lead research and support society to reach the highest level of accessibility. The Director is accountable for reviewing and updating ESDC s accessibility plans every three years, and prior to updating plans, directs consultations with people with disabilities on needed changes and improvements. The Director plays a leadership role in ensuring a cohesive approach to the implementation of the plan, including corporate reporting, by managing proactive relationships with other business leads in the department. The incumbent ensures the Division's participation in various working groups, committees and sub-committees where accessibility issues and ideas are discussed by various stakeholders, including employees and clients with disabilities. Such involvement is key, not only in terms of gathering rich information on barriers to access, but also in terms of fostering a sense of a shared agenda. The Director is instrumental in advancing the Department's objective of developing and maintaining a vibrant relationship with the Employees with Disabilities Network, the Employment Strategy for Canadians with Disabilities. Through consultations and feedback from people with disabilities, the incumbent provides strategic data that informs setting annual targets for recruitment and promotion of persons who self-identify with disabilities. The Director provides insight on possible reasons for gaps in the number of disabled employees such as the possible positive co-relation between retention and the provision of accessible work tools. The incumbent also directs analysis into the circumstances around the reluctance to self-identify and leads 3
engagement strategies that provide a safe venue for employees with disabilities. The incumbent also provides expert advice and recommendations on such HR-related issues as on-boarding employees with disabilities and recommends solutions for both managers and employees on improving the process. The Director plays a crucial role in advancing accessibility initiatives by providing comprehensive support to the Departmental Accessibility Champion. The Director will collaborate closely with the Champion to develop and implement strategies that promote inclusivity and remove barriers for individuals with disabilities. In supporting the Champion, the Director must possess strong leadership skills, excellent communication abilities, and a passion for creating an inclusive environment for all employees and clients. The incumbent collaborates with counterparts at the Office of Public Service Accessibility (OPSA) to share knowledge and to assess projects seeking funds from the Centralized Enabling Fund for innovative and experimental ideas, projects and initiatives aimed at removing barriers and improving workplace accommodation practices at ESDC. The Director supports the Director General to engage with not-for-profit organizations whose mandate is to expand disability inclusion and reaches agreement on utilizing such organizations existing learning solutions for departmental managers and employees. The Director is accountable for the development and submission of regular progress reports that describe the actions the Department has taken to implement accessibility plans. Reports also include information on feedback received and how ESDC took the feedback into consideration in improving disability inclusion. The incumbent ensures systematic consultation with persons with disabilities on the content of the report, which ensures that the persons with disabilities have a voice in reporting results. The Director represents the position of the Department in the interdepartmental fora. The incumbent engages with officials in Accessibility Standards Canada, the Office of Accessibility Commissioner, the office of the Chief Accessibility Officer, and the Office of Public Service Accessibility and speaks authoritatively on behalf of the Director General and the ADM on accessibility inclusion matters. The Director develops and maintains networks with organizations advocating on behalf of persons with disabilities and shares knowledge on disability inclusion programs and tools developed in the public and private sectors. The incumbent is accountable for planning and organizing communications and events for National AccessAbility Week with support from the College, an annual event to celebrate the contributions of people with disabilities and promotes inclusion and accessibility in communities and workplaces across Canada. The Director must possess a wide range of knowledge regarding disability inclusion legislation, regulations, standards and tools. In addition to the Department's acts and regulations, and the Accessible Canada Act, the incumbent must be well-versed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Director must also be knowledgeable about the numerous organizations involved in advocating for the rights of person with disabilities, their objectives, leaders, and key opinion-shapers. Knowledge of the Accessibility Standards Canada and accessibility standards regulations is also essential in the development of accessibility plans, programs, and tools. As well, the incumbent must have a knowledge of HR-related legislation, including the Public Service Employment Act, the Employment Equity Act, and the Public Service Modernization Act, as well as familiarity with the Canada Labour Code and Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations in the context of their impact on 4
disability inclusion. The Director draws on this knowledge in the development of accessibility plans and applying the accessibility lens in the development and review of policies and programs, especially where specific statutes may be in conflict. The Director provides expert advice, briefings and recommendations to the Director General, ADM, and other senior decision-makers across the Department on the management of sensitive issues and advises on the immediate and medium-term implications of accessibility and inclusion policies, initiatives and their interaction with other policy and program initiatives. Given human rights, accessibility and inclusivity implications, the incumbent must use sound judgement and political acumen in developing recommendations on inclusion policies and programs and analyzing positions in terms of knock-on effects. The Director leads by example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining professional expertise. The incumbent must demonstrate strong management and operational skills, sound judgement and operating environment acumen, and manage allocated resources with probity.

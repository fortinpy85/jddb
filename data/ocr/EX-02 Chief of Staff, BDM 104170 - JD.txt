Organization Structure: The Chief of Staff is one of many senior positions reporting to the DM- BDM. The others are the: Assistant Deputy Minister, BDM; senior business lead, DGs Special Projects with close links to IITB and PCO. Nature and Scope: ESDC, which includes Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Overseen by four federal Ministers, the Department operates under the direction the Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development; the Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development and Chief Operating Officer for Service Canada; the Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development; the Deputy Minister of Labour, and the Chief Transformation Officer. The Department provides a range of programs and services that support Canadians at all stages of life, including for seniors, unemployed workers, parents raising young children, and students needing assistance to finance their post-secondary education. The Department fosters inclusive growth by providing opportunity and assistance to Canadians with distinct needs, such as Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities. homeless people and recent immigrants: oversees labour relations, occupational health and safety. labour standards. employment equity and workers compensation in the federal jurisdiction; delivers programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies, such as Passport services for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada IRCC). and to veterans on behalf of Veterans Affairs Canada.
ESDC also designs and delivers through Service Canada s multichannel service delivery network a number of Government of Canada programs that provide benefits for Canadians, including Employment Insurance. Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement. Canada Student Loans and Grants. Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program; the Wage Earner Protection Program: and more recently. special social and economic measures programs, such as the Canada Emergency Relief Benefits provided to assist individuals and employers experiencing income loss/financial hardship due to the 2O2O global COVID-I9 pandemic. Service Canada s national service delivery infrastructure serves as a primary point of contact for persons seeking information or to access Government of Canada services and benefits. Services are provided online via the Internet, through Service Canada s Specialized Call Centres, and at more than 6OO points of service across Canada. This includes some 32O+ in-person centres, 239+ scheduled outreach locations, and 32 Government of Canada passport offices. Through this network, more than $I2O billion in El, OAS, CPP & CPP Disability pensions and benefits are processed and distributed to Canadians each year, which enable access to other government programs and services, such as the Temporary Foreign Workers Program, Student Loans, Grants & Contributions, etc. Service Canada continues to grow and build its capacity to meet the ever increasing demand for services. However, the technology infrastructure needed to serve clients is fragile and archaic in many respects, dating back in part to the I96Os and I97Os. Although the Department has made progress in introducing digital platforms, the shortfalls are evident through client feedback. At present, few services for mobile devices exist and clients also complain that the existing online systems, which were designed for the older service model, are confusing and not user-friendly. Given these shortcomings, changes must be made in terms of policy and program simplification to make the process more easily understood, improve the client service experience, better enable staff to provide enhanced client support, and address the substantial income support benefits that remain unclaimed each year due to the barriers some clients face in accessing benefits services - particularly in Northern, remote and rural communities where enabling and expanding services to reach these communities is a priority for the Government of Canada. In line with its Service Transformation Plan, ESDC has developed a Blueprint for Benefits Delivery Modernization which sets out a clear vision for service transformation, identifies the inherent risks, and defines a target state operating model for 2O3O - including the business processes, organization, technical infrastructure and information that will be required to successfully modernize and streamline the delivery of benefits services for Canadians.

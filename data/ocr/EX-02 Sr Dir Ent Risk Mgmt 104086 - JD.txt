Overseen by four federal Ministers, the Department operates under the direction the Deputy Senior Director, Enterprise Risk Management Page | de 5 February 4", 2O2O
MeN Seema" Seeman Minister, ESDC; the Senior Associate Deputy Minister ESDC who is also the Chief Operating Officer of Service Canada; the Associate Deputy Minister, ESDC; and the Deputy Minister, Labour Program. The Department provides a range of programs and services that support Canadians at all stages of life, including for seniors, unemployed workers, parents raising young children, and students needing assistance to finance their post-secondary education; fosters inclusive growth by providing opportunity and assistance to Canadians with distinct needs, such as Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, homeless people and recent immigrants: oversees labour relations, occupational health and safety, labour standards, employment equity and workers compensation in the federal jurisdiction; provides funding to support projects in the voluntary and private sector; and delivers programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies, such as Passport services for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and to veterans on behalf of Veterans Affairs Canada. ESDC also designs and delivers through Service Canada s multichannel service delivery network - a number of Government of Canada programs that provide benefits for Canadians. including Employment Insurance, Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement. Canada Student Loans and Grants. Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program; the Wage Earner Protection Program; and others. The Department employs a staff of approximately 29,OOO situated at Headquarters and at the Service Canada regional offices, contact centres and in-person points of service across Canada (approximately 6OO points of service in total). The Internal Audit and Enterprise Risk Management Branch plays a dual role serving as the focal point within ESDC for matters relating to Internal Audit which is concerned with the design, operation and overall integrity of the Department's risk management, governance and internal control processes, and the Enterprise Risk Management function which is strategically focused on corporate risk tolerance and the strategic identification and mitigation of known and emerging risks that may affect departmental performance and results. Each of these two business lines operate as distinct organizational entities independent of the other and must do so, in order to safeguard the independence/integrity of the Branch s internal audit work. The Branch fulfils its mandate in accordance with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Policy on Internal Audit, the Internal Auditors International Professional Practices Framework, the TBS Framework for the Management of Risk, and the TBS Management Accountability Framework (MAF) which establishes the Government's expectations for the sound management of the Public Service, the management accountability of Deputy Heads, and for the improvement of management practices across federal departments and agencies. In carrying out its mandate, the Branch exercises unrestricted access to all departmental records, databases, workplaces and employees in order to provide assurances to the Deputy Head and departmental executives as to the adequacy of the Department's integrated frameworks and processes for risk management, control and governance. The Enterprise Risk Management Division is a new centre of expertise created within the Internal Audit and Enterprise Risk Management Branch to further the integration of risk management into the Department's existing governance and organizational structures, and to strengthen its capacity to recognize and strategically manage risks that may affect departmental performance/results. As the departmental lead for Enterprise Risk Management, the Sr. Director, Enterprise Risk Management is accountable for fostering a risk-aware culture, driving the department-wide adoption of a principles-based approach to risk management, and building capacity and Senior Director, Enterprise Risk Management Page 2 de 5 February 4", 2O2O
MeN Seema" Seeman strengthening risk management competence across the ESDC Portfolio. The principles-based approach is articulated in the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's Framework for the Management of Risk and provides flexibility enabling federal departments and agencies to tailor their risk management solutions to reflect their respective mandate and objectives. It also enables strategic risk-informed oversight, supports strategic priority setting and resource allocation, contributes to improved performance and results, and informs decisions with respect to risk tolerance in all areas of work, including policy and program development and major investments. The Sr. Director is further accountable for developing and maintaining the Department's Corporate Risk Profile, risk tolerance indicators, standards and policies, and the associated governance and reporting structures; furthering the integration of risks into the Department's corporate plans and strategies: assessing and advising from an Enterprise-level perspective, on the risk implications of proposed policy and program initiatives, major investments, partnerships, and other actions that may affect the achievement of its strategic objectives and priorities; and directing risk-related research and analysis to inform the Department's high-level decision-making processes. The Sr. Director also champions continuous learning and improvement with respect to Enterprise Risk Management across the ESDC Portfolio and directs the design and delivery of learning programs and tools designed to build the risk management competencies of departmental leaders, create a more risk-aware culture, support risk tolerance discussion, encourage innovation, and further the adoption of risk-informed principles and practices at all levels of the organization. The Sr. Director supports the Chief Risk Officer's commitment to the Deputy Ministers and Parliament to formally bring consideration of risk into the Department's strategic decision- making processes. The incumbent is charged with developing a Center of Expertise for strategic risk management; providing evidence-based, integrated risk information at the Enterprise level, including an informed assessment of the effectiveness of the Department's risk management strategies; conceptualizing and recommending measures to strengthen risk management across the organization; and guiding and supporting departmental leaders in managing risks within their respective organizations. The role impacts on all client policy and program activities and ultimately, the Department's overall performance and program expenditures. Further, the Sr. Director highlights and ensures concerns relating to the state of ERM within the Department are communicated to the Chief Risk Officer, the Deputy Ministers and to the Portfolio Board as appropriate; directs the preparation of the Department's formal reports and responses to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, the Office of the Comptroller General of Canada, and Parliament on the performance of the Department with respect to Enterprise Risk Management; and reviews and performs a challenge function regarding the risk mitigation component of departmental plans, reports and submissions to Treasury Board and Cabinet. Major challenges of the position include the sheer scale and diversity of the ESDC Portfolio which encompasses all of its social and economic development programs, as well as Service Canada s multi-faceted national operations, and the Labour Program each of which has unique and highly-complex risks associated with their mandates. The Sr. Director is expected to establish a coherent Enterprise-wide approach to risk management; to guide the development of risk mitigation measures reflecting the specific mandates and operational realities of each; and to review and challenge the risk management measures each of the business lines will Senior Director, Enterprise Risk Management Page 3 de 5 February 4", 2O2O
MeN Seema" Seeman employ to proactively identify and resolve risks/threat that may affect departmental performance and results and impede the delivery of programs and services for Canadians. Significant challenges are also faced in the collaborative work with branches that play a key role in the management of risks, particularly the Enterprise Project Management Office/Chief Financial Officer Branch with respect to Portfolio investments and projects, the Office of the Chief Innovation & Technology Branch on IT investments, partnerships, and service delivery, the Chief Transformation Officer Branch, the Service Canada Business Modernization Branch, the Program Operations branch on risks associated with departmental Grants and Contributions programs, the Integrity Services Branch on fraud risks, and the Corporate Secretariat with respect to privacy risks. While each branch has unique requirements where tailoring the risk management approach to their individual area of responsibility may be appropriate, there remains the need to standardize wherever possible in order to enable the integration of risks at the Enterprise-level. The work involves significant pressures and is further complicated by the fact that more than one ADM can be responsible for different aspects of a single program or services thus compounding the challenge of coherently integrating risk information at the Enterprise-level. Further, the diversity and visibility of the programs, services and benefits provided by the Department for Canadians, as well as the magnitude of expenditures involved - and the scale of the information that must be analyzed and integrated, add to the complexity and challenges faced by the Sr. Director who must correctly articulate and communicate the Enterprise-level risks of which the Deputy Ministers, the Portfolio Board, and departmental leaders must remain cognizant. Finally, given the dual nature of the Branch mandate, the Sr. Director must ensure the Enterprise Risk Management Division functions as a separate organizational entity, removed from the Branch s internal audit work where complete objectivity and independence is essential.

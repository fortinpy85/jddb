NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Lead by five Ministers and five Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. In 2O2I-22, ESDC expenditures on programs and services totalled $I78.3B. Of this amount, more than 95% directly benefitted Canadians through El, CPP, OAS and other statutory transfer payments. Service Canada forms the program delivery arm of ESDC, managing over 37 programs with 66 streams and over 52 thousand grants and contributions (Gs&Cs) agreements as one of the largest and most diverse Gs&Cs portfolios across the Government of Canada (GoC). Service Canada provides Canadians with a single point of access to ESDC programs and helps Canadians access other GoC programs and services. One of these programs, the TFW Program facilitates access to an important labour pool for Canadian businesses because, when qualified Canadians are not available, ESDC/Service Canada s TFW Program allows Canadian employers to hire foreign workers to fill temporary jobs. The Program is regulated through the /mmigration and Refugee Protection Act and the immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations and is administered in partnership with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Within the ESDC portfolio, the TFW Program Branch is mandated to respond to evolving labour market conditions by efficiently addressing employers labour market needs, and ensuring foreign workers are protected, while fostering a public service that supports the Program s vision. The Branch provides leadership in an agile methodology and model that brings together Policy, Operations, and Compliance directorates within one Branch. The policy to service continuum framework, consists of five phases: initiation; planning; development: implementation, and monitoring and control. As part of the framework, the Director General is accountable for collaborating with colleagues from the outset, identifying strategic opportunities for program enhancement and addressing program needs, providing expert advice and guidance on the operational context and potential impacts in order to help shape effective solutions. As the work moves to implementation, the Director General is responsible for creating and leading the national delivery network to bring the policy/program changes into effect within the operational teams of the four regions. The incumbent consults with counterparts across four Regions and any other departmental partners and other government departments or provinces/territories (as required) to ensure an understanding of the operational implications of the change. The Director General must take into consideration a myriad of regional/geographical considerations into the national direction and strategies and is responsible for orchestrating the effectiveness of tools supporting the program delivery. Operating within the Policy to Service Continuum increases the complexity of service delivery because the Policy, Operations and Compliance areas are developing and implementing changes within the same timeframes. 3
Further, the Director General works closely with the Policy Directorate to inform future planning and program changes. The incumbent directs the planning of operational implementation and works in lock step with the other directorates and applicable branches to ensure a coherent approach. Given the agile / iterative development approach, the Director General faces challenges in assuring the integrity of processes where the initiation and planning phases must take place simultaneously. The incumbent must work within the Departmental framework for Project Management and leads major and minor projects through the appropriate governance mechanisms to provide transparent and proactive leadership ensuring the project aligns with Departmental priorities, manages resources effectively and delivers expected business results. The Director General, Operations oversees the development of key documents such as funding and budget proposals, Treasury Board Submissions, briefing decks, reports/analysis and any memos required to seek approval for program changes and to obtain approval and funding as required. The incumbent also provides expert advice to the ADM and Governance Committees on operational considerations and program requirements regarding potential program changes and the positions most likely to be raised by stakeholders and partners. This presents a significant challenge in the TFW Program's multi-jurisdictional operating environment where initiatives and issues are increasingly interconnected and interdependent and where events arise that affect the Program's agenda but are beyond its direct control. The Director General leads in consultation with counterparts in the Policy and Compliance Directorates, Service Canada Regions and other relevant partners on the development of operational guidance, multi-media training materials and other tools. The incumbent directs engagement with the involved internal and external partners to identify the impact of implementing the changes, including creating internal working groups based on the impacts and complexity of the changes. The Director General oversees amendments to operational guides and ensures changes are validated with the Service Canada Regions prior to finalization. Subsequently, the incumbent directs the development of tools required to support the new changes. Documentation includes any updates to letters, forms, training plans and materials, and external and internal operational service-delivery related communication materials and web contents. The development of operational guides and tools for use at the national level presents the incumbent with a considerable challenge in terms of ensuring the clarity and utility of guidance to heterogenous audiences while safeguarding the integrity of the guides intent and application. The incumbent is accountable for providing executive leadership in directing and enabling processes, approaches and tools that provide for effective performance assessment of the Program and its initiatives, overseeing the management of the evaluative process in order to enable the provision of expert and strategic advice that impacts the national framework, service delivery and performance. The Director General is also responsible for leading the funding allocations, working in collaboration with regional DGs and Chief Financial Officer Branch, taking a multitude of considerations into account and developing workload management principles and objectives for each fiscal year. In order to optimize the Directorate' s success in implementing its varied and demanding mandate, the DG leads the development of client-focussed, results-based national plans and performance measurement and accountability and reporting frameworks which in many cases must reflect the priorities and interests of multiple partners. It is important the incumbent institute strong quality control and performance measurement indicators to enhance the success of these processes. 4
In order to effectively communicate the necessary changes regarding program changes, addressing issues from clients, internal and external stakeholders, including the Regions and provinces/territories, the DG acts as a bridge between strategic priorities and operational reality and the divergent perspectives held by the multitude of organizations and partners involved with the program. The Director General, Operations is responsible for the development and dissemination of all external and internal client facing web content and updates, operational service-delivery related communication products, operational web contents, and IT systems solutions. The Director General oversees collaboration with Citizens Services Branch (CSB) on any web updates for the TFW Program Branch. The Director General provides well-informed and integrated advice, briefings, and recommendations on TFW program issues and opportunities to the ADM, COO, DM and other involved senior officials across ESDC and Service Canada. This broad perspective gives the ADM and other senior decision-makers the necessary information in an operating environment with myriad interdependencies and interconnections across several jurisdictions and among diverse stakeholders. The Director General is expected to provide advice and recommendations on sensitive issues in domestic and international arenas, often under severe time constraints. The Director General must provide sound and strategic advice that the ADM and Service Canada officials can act upon with trust and confidence, some in high-profile domestic and international political fora. Early internal/external engagement with all stakeholders has been identified as a best practice in adopting the Policy to Service continuum. Accordingly, the Director General, Operations establishes and manages numerous and diverse relationships, across the Department with involved Branches, and among OGDs, particularly IRCC and CBSA, provinces, territories, private sector parties and international entities. The Director General personally manages partnerships with provincial and federal officials such as the Quebec Ministry of Immigration, Francisation and Integration and Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada in the operationalization of program delivery. The incumbent ensures that partners program delivery is aligned with TFW Program's positions and that it is operating effectively. The provinces and territories put forward varying requirements regarding the employment contracts, whereas Quebec requires a Qu bec Acceptance Certificate as well as the federal permit. Program Operation s success is premised to a great degree on the Director General's relationship management skills in terms of operationalizing the program nationally with a large cast of actors. The incumbent interacts with several key external stakeholders and Program users to address national processing issues and gather data on client experience for LMIA process and systems. The Director General draws on highly developed interpersonal skills, personal credibility and operational and political acumen to foster agreement on program directions and changes among stakeholders over which the incumbent has no direct authority. The Director General represents the interests and positions of the Branch and Department in inter/intradepartmental consultations and negotiations to build consensus on program positions that cut across mandates. The Director General is a member/chair of the Directors General Interdepartmental Committee, the Director General Trilaterial committee and the branch management committee. To capitalize on opportunities to improve the experience of both employers and workers, the Director General leads and directs the development and testing of various innovations to streamline processes, better respond to labour market conditions, and reduce the administrative burden for employers proven to be compliant. In leading such innovative approaches, 5
consideration must be given to displacing domestic workers. Supported by data, the Director General oversees the provision of robust, efficient, and client-centric service delivery by promoting and implementing service innovations through technology, communications, quality management and training. In keeping with internal/external engagement strategy, the incumbent ensures that there is input on innovation from across the Branch, colleagues in Service Canada and other stakeholders. The Director General leads the development of the Program Operations results measurement framework in collaboration with regional counterparts of Service Canada to monitor and evaluate the impact on the quantity and quality of the service delivery. Given the simultaneous development of policy, operations and compliance program segments, this is a complicated undertaking. The Director General must ensure that the involved directorates and branches are clear on what they are trying to achieve and how success is to be measured. The incumbent uses the resulting information to develop the changes necessary improve service delivery, all in concert with the Policy and Compliance Directorates and stakeholders across the country. This information is also used in reports to executive committees and the DMs. The TFW Program s Policy to Service Continuum makes significant knowledge demands of the executive cadre, especially since the model is successful only if the three streams, specifically policy, service and compliance are planned, developed and implemented concurrently. Expert technical know-how is required to manage operations involving the volume and complexity of sensitive issues, each one requiring consultation with stakeholders informed by a thorough understanding of intra/interdepartmental governance and interjurisdictional arrangements and associated touch points. The Director General leads by example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining professional expertise. The incumbent must demonstrate strong operational/organizational skills, sound judgement and operating environment acumen, and manage allocated resources with probity.

NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. Employment and Social Development Canada's mandate is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to help Canadians live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians quality of life. The Department supports Canadians throughout their lives, by assisting families with spending more time with their newborns, more high quality, affordable childcare options, or simply more money to care for their children, helping students finance their post-secondary education, supporting unemployed workers and providing seniors with income security. ESDC provides a leadership role and focal point for federal social, labour market and economic programs related to the development of Canada s human capital. The Strategic and Service Policy Branch (SSPB) develops and coordinates policy advice and analysis across the Department. The responsibilities of the Branch include the development of economic, social and service policies, and research activities related to ESDC's mandate. It is also the focal point for portfolio-wide strategic planning and priority setting; analysis, guidance and oversight on service-related issues; the Innovation Lab; program evaluation; Cabinet and regulatory affairs; International and intergovernmental relations; and housing. Within SSPB, the Economic Policy Directorate (EPD) provides strategic research, analysis, and economic advice on skills development, labour market, Indigenous, and economic issues with a view to promoting a competitive, growing, and inclusive economy. It assesses Canada's current 3
and future labour market and skills needs to help ensure that ESDC s policies and programs are aligned with these needs and develops innovative responses to emerging challenges. The impacts of a global pandemic have created unprecedented challenges to labour economists in mapping the way forward in a post-pandemic economy with an efficient labour market. Pre- pandemic mega-trends impacting the labour market and skills development such as population aging and a transition toward a carbon-low economy are still present, while some others (automation, digitalization) have been accelerated by the pandemic. These trends also permanently changed consumer behaviours and forced organizations to revise their business models, which has already started to impact skills sought by these organizations as well as occupation in labour shortages and surplus. In this context, the Director General provides professional and managerial leadership in supporting the development of ESDC s economic policy agenda by assessing how the economic context (e.g., high inflation, potential recession, Canada demography and other mega-trends) impacts ESDC mandate, more specifically regarding the Canadian labour market and skills development of Canadians, including those in Nunavut. The incumbent ensures the economic agenda align with both the policy directions of other government departments (OGDs) and the major priorities of the government as a whole. The Director General provides leadership and direction in the overall coordination and an integrated lateral perspective within the Department and across the federal policy community with respect to major corporate and national policy interactions. The incumbent provides the creative and intellectual focal point in leading an integrated approach to economic policy in a multi-stakeholder and multi-jurisdictional arena and generates a combination of results that are measurable in the short to medium terms and sustainable over the longer term. The Director General provides ESDC s focal analytic point on the Government of Canada s economic priorities, such as a Green and Inclusive Canadian Economy and on Indigenous Reconciliation by providing robust empirical-based labour market economic analysis. The incumbent directs robust labour market analysis and the development of policy options to facilitate underrepresented groups integration in the labour market and more specifically in the North to ensure the department continues to meet its legal obligations under Article 23 of the Nunavut Agreement. The Director General provides the ADM, DMs and Ministers with strategic, policy-relevant and timely economic advice on the broad array of ESDC's priorities and the analyses of the choices confronting policy decision-makers. The short hierarchical distance between the incumbent, as advisor and key briefer, and the senior decision-makers, makes this role both sensitive and challenging, especially when advice and recommendations are required on short notice. The Director General draws on sound judgment, operating environment acumen, and broad experience in providing advice and recommendations that solve issues in the short-term while avoiding any knock-on outcomes. The Director General frames ESDC s position on key trends and challenges regarding Canada s labour market and skills development, provides the lead in challenging internal and external analyses and on policy and program priorities. In the challenge role, the Director General must be both diplomat and pragmatist in offering critiques of others analyses where paths forward diverge and in bringing all involved onside. 4
The Director General's vision for the EPD research plan positions the Directorate as the centre of expertise in labour economics within ESDC and across the Government of Canada. The incumbent oversees robust economic research and analysis and policy -relevant data development in order to shine a light on emerging trends, explore key economic and policy considerations and close specific knowledge gaps. Further, the Director General ensures a broad and efficient diffusion of EPD research and analyses within ESDC portfolio, across federal departments (e.g., PCO, Finance Canada, IRCC, Statistics Canada, ISED, etc.) and other international and domestic research organizations (e.g., OECD, Canadian academics and research centers, etc.). This confirms that ESDC s research agenda is well aligned with Government of Canada s priorities and the Department's analyses and research findings complement those from other research organizations in support of sound policies and programs. To fulfill Canada s legal obligations described in Article 23 of the Nunavut Agreement, the Director General is accountable for a research program to inf orm the Inuit Employment Plans (IEPs) and Pre-Employment Training Plans (PETPs) of the Government of Nunavut and federal departments in Nunavut and increase Inuit employment in government in Nunavut. The incumbent ensures a research agenda that increases understanding of the key barriers, best practices, and opportunities to labour force participation in the North, specifically in public administration. The Director General oversees dedicated research, analyses, and ongoing engagement with Indigenous partners in a co-development model. This includes the Nunavut Inuit Labour Force Analysis (NILFA), using qualitative and quantitative methodologies, stakeholder engagement and the NILFA hub, which is an interactive data visualization tool enabling an efficient dissemination of relevant NILFA reports, data and key information to IEP and PETP developers. The Director General has extensive representational responsibilities at the most senior levels among OGDs, central agencies, and speaks authoritatively on behalf of the Department. The incumbent leads EDP s outreach strategy and engages other Chief Economists and Directors General, Economic Research from among others, Global Affairs Canada, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Finance Canada and Statistics Canada. The incumbent also engages with Canadian and international academics specializing in labour economics, as well as Canadian and international private research organizations, such as CD Howe, Institute for Research on Public Policy, and CIRANO. The Director General represents Canada with international organizations, such as OECD, (Education Policy Committee and Centre for Educational Research and Innovation Governing Board) and represent ESDC domestically on different advisory boards (e.g., Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey Board). The Director General leads by example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining professional expertise. The incumbent must demonstrate strong operational/organizational skills, sound judgment, and operating environment acumen, and manage allocated resources with probity.

As well, the Director provides corporate functional direction for the assigned portfolio across HRDC' s NHQs and Regional organizations to ensure the consistency and coherence of the departmental-level Briefings, Cabinet, Regulatory and Parliamentary Affairs services. NATURE AND SCOPE In I992, Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) was established through the amalgamation of major components of four former departments. These were the Employment organizations of the former CEIC, all of the Department of Labour, all the social welfare programming from the former Health and Welfare Canada, and the social development and literacy programming of the former Secretary of State. This created, what is still today. the largest program expenditure department in the Government of Canada. 39 cents of every federal dollar is expended through HRDC and the department impacts directly on over I2 million citizens across all strata of Canada s society and economy. The federal commitments announced in recent Budgets and Speeches from the Throne ( .g., Literacy and Skills, workforce reskilling. inclusion of children and youth who are marginalized, more student assistance, increased human resources development agenda for Aboriginal citizens, etc..) will expand HRDC's influence and citizen-based service delivery even further. Senior management have recently embarked on a major renewal exercise for the Department due to perceived inefliciencies and onussions in the overall corporate management capacity of HRDC. This intuative was supported by the public debate about the Grants and Contribution Internal Audit Report. and subsequent Auditor General and central agency scrutiny and observations. This crystallized the DMQ s belief that there was a need lar more strategic, integrated and responsive corporate support services for the DMO and Ministers, clearer program accountability mechanisms and stronger and improved corporate management practices and processes to ensure the probity and integrity of HRDC programs and their expenditures. rn vO UO rrrrr W>ODaaa
Fhaman Resources and Skills Development Canada. se Views were contimed by the recommendations of consulting studies, (e.g.. PricewaterhouseCoopers winng study) which recommended (I) stronger intemal linkages and cohesion across HRDC to better support the Ministers, the DM and their Offices; (iI) a better definition of the accountabilities of all Executive program heads to ensure required interfaces occurred: and (iii) the clear definition of the responsibilities and accountabilities of corporate and regional organizations in HRDC s functional and business lines. In recognition of these needs, the DMO announced the creation of the new Corporate Affairs and Planning Branch. The DM. stated in a letter to all employees - A Corporate Affairs and Planning Branch will be established to support an integrated management process for HRDC. This new branch will work closely with all parts of the department in establishing strategic directions .... The branch will also play a key role in supporting EMC [Pxccutive Management Committee] in effective issues management .... A special challenge will be to ensure that this new branch complements and builds on existing structures ... in order to help us achieve our objectives. In developing and designing this new Branch, two responsibilities were identified as paramount by the DMO, namely the accountabilities to: I. the Deputy Minister for the development of departmental business plans and performance management and reporting, and 2. to enhance and provide support to the Ministers Offices. It asin this complex and demanding operational context and new corporate management and governance regime that the Director, Briefings, Cabinet, Regulatory and Parliamentary Affairs is accountable for: (i) strengthened and anticipatory corporate services and support for the Ministers and DMO conceming their responsibilities and participation in Cabinet and Parliament and their external representational and advocacy roles; (ii) revitalized Briefings and Regulatory Affairs program services and support to the DMO and Ministers; (iii) providing authoritative information to, and linkages with, the corporate Executives and Committees of HRDC on the requirements and positions of the Ministers and DMO for the assigned programs; (iv) ensuring linkages between horizontal policy, program, resource and service delivery priorities, issues and orientations to provide the best integrated and comprehensive information and advisory services to the Ministers and DMO: and (v) strengthened corporate information dissemination processes regarding the activities of the Ministers and DMO to enhance the horizontal and integrated corporate management of the department The Director achieves these objectives through four major spheres of business activity; namely Briefings, Cabinet, Regulatory and Parhamentary Affairs and through establishing the appropnate level of Ministerial support and liaison with the Offices of the Minister of Labour and the Secretary of State through locating service providers in these Offices. While much of this corporate machinery existed before, due to its assigned mandate and priorities, it operated mainly at the level of general coordination and administration with no real national or corporate leadership, challenge and quality control authority. Due to its limited authority for its assigned programs over the HQs and Regional organizations, and its limited resource base and capabilities. it operated mainly trom a reactive and request-driven service delivery mode. With the new DMO priorities tor stronger corporate management for HRDC s overall business activities and the stronger and more proactive and anticipatory support for the Ministers and the DMO, the Director Is challenged lo revitalize the management frameworks of the existing programs. The incumbent must also develop the new. strategic and innovative services and support required to fill perceived gaps in HRDC s corporate support to these Executive Offices. It is critical that the incumbent ensures the Division's priorities and orientations are aligned with and best support the strategic and business goals, objectives and needs of these Senior Executives This requires the development of new national frameworks, standards and processes and ensuring that products and services are developed, either in-house or through coordination with all HQs and Regional organizations, to best meet the service requirements of these key corporate clients. The new govemance frameworks for the programs must ensure the highest quality of the required services and their timeliness and viability for the use of the Ministers and DMO. These corporate clients can not be expected to perform their responsibilities before Cabinet and Parliament. in the federal regulatory process and other fora without support products and services of the highest quality. Errors or deficiencies can result in great embarrassment to the Ministers and DMO and can 3
flaman Resouces and Skill Development Canada lower public confidence in the department and the federal government as effective institutions for public daUTMistration. As well as developing the new programming and orientations, the Director must act as an agent of change to lead the Division in developing or acquiring the required attributes and competencies for its managers and employees to effectively meet the Division's key service delivery priorities. This is a difficult task as, given the range of HRDC's policy and program portfolios, there is a massive volume of activities in the assigned portfolio that greatly execed the scope and range of similar requirements found in any other federal department. The Director develops the management frameworks. systems and processes for these functions to effectively deal with the large volume and to add strategic analysis, quality control, writing and advisory capacities to enhance the support to the Executive Offices. This involves developing new interfaces with all HQs Branches and the Regions that ensure their involvement in the development of the new governance frameworks. These clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of all parties and the overnding responsibility and authority of the Division to control and coordinate the portfolio s support programs for HRDC s corporate Executive Offices. The Briefing function requires strong leadership, management and coordination skills as the volume, variety and complexity of briefings provided is enormous. This Is due to the vast range of HRDC policies and programs and the interest and scrutiny they invite from MPs, other levels of government, the media and other domestic and intemational partes. The Director ensures the Briefings activities, services and products enhance all Cabinet. Regulatory and Parliamentary affairs activities and policy and program initiatives of the three Ministers, respond effectively to questions and concems raised by their Offices, and those of the DMO, and meet their information and decision-making requirements. This is a challenging activity given the magnitude of HRDC and the mvolyement of up to 26 officials at the Senior ADM, ADM and Regional Executive Head (REH) level many of whom are simultaneously involved in the preparation, approval and submission of Briefings to the Ministers and DMO, and who can hold diftering optics. In these situations, the Director brokers or facilitates agreements between these officials that are acceptable to all parties, or ensures the Bneting notes provide the preferred approach while noting the alternative options and optics. The Briefing requirements and demands of the Ministers are increasing due to their growing desire to be well positioned to address all aspects of their respecuive portfolios and to ensure they are not surprised and unable to address an issue in any public forum, event or situation, The Director must ensure that the service is provided in a timely way and in the tone and style that best suits the involved Minister and the DM and that it is also viable, integrated and considers the positions and concems of HRDC Executives and those of other key federal players and involved clients, stakeholders and partners. A new approach introduced in the Division Is the conduct of specific targeted briefings on issues that the Director believes are emerging or require specific focus for the Ministers and the DMO. Briefings that are not well prepared, screened and which do not have an integrated HRDC context. or that have ill-considered the opinions and positions of key stakeholders, can result in public embarrassment to the Ministers and lower the public s confidence in the department. The Director also directs, through this Section, the services required to coordinate and support the domestic travel of the Ministers and the DM and the coordination and increasingly the preparation, of briefings and documents related to these trips and for the Ministers and DM's participation in events they accept to attend. Similarly the Director directs this Section in the corporate oversight of the development or preparation of Ministerial and IDM announcements and the development of transition hooks when there Is a change in Ministers or DM. The Cabinet and Regulatory Affairs programs also pose major challenges to the Director. The Ministers and DMO have stated they require more strategic, more HRDC-integrated and more federal government- comprehensive Cabinet and Regulatory Affairs services and support. This is a major departure from the former modes of operations for these functions. The Director is developing the required program response including directing the implementation of more proactive interfaces with the officials in the House of Commons and the PCO concerning the scheduling and agendas of these Committees and the tracking and identification of issues. Mhis ensures areas of direct involvement, or of interest and concem to the Ministers and DMO are identified and advisory services can be provided accordingly. It also allows the priorities and preferences of the Ministers and DMO to be negotiated with these officials. In these ways tie incumbent can ensure the Ministers and DMO are ey a
Human Resources and Skills Develapment Canada t informed. prepared and supported by HRDC to conduct their responsibilities and participation in Cabinet and the federal Regulatory process, and their representational and advocacy roles, and to deal with issues at these levels requiring their leadership, advocacy or attention. The Cabinet Affairs activities are again voluminous and complex, given the three Ministers. the range of HRDC's policy and program portfohos, and the number of Cabinet issues and Cabinet Committees they involve The provision of these services requires the Director to develop extensive networks not only within HRDC but also across the wide range of federal central agencies and departments involved in its sphere of operations. This assists the Director in intonming these officials of the initiatives, priorities and concerns of the Ministers, DMO and HIRDC and also in identifying simitar matters in their portfolios requiring disclosure to the Ministers and DMO so they can determine their levels of interest. and possible involvement. A vital aspect of the Cabinet Attairs function is the leading role the Director plays in directing the preparation or coordination of the briefing notes, speaking notes, decks, etc., for all Cabinet documents on the agenda of all Cabinet Committees. For both the Cabinet and Regulatory program areas, the Director ensures the development and provision of required backgrounders, summaries and position papers and controls all briefing materials directly linked to the respective Commuttee s agenda items. This requires the Director to ensure that all possible opinions and opposition or challenge to HRDC postions are identified and appropriate strategies developed to assist the Ministers and DMO in successfully dealing with these issues, As well, the Director directs through this Section, the control over the progress of all Cabinet documents and interfaces with Strategic Policy and other involved Branches and Regions to ensure the appropriate development of strategies for these major documents. This facilitates their approval within the DMO and Ministers Offices and their optimal processing through and reception by Cabinet and involved Cabinet Committees. The Director also feads. through this Division, the development of the long term agenda and annual plans for HRDC's regulatory authorities for tabling and presentation by the Ministers at the Special Committee of Council that approves all federal Regulations. This activity requires the development of innovative and forward-looking approaches as the recent Regulatory Review exercise, completed under the leadership of the PCO, determined that the federal government would move from heavy prescriptive compliance approaches to models that promote voluntary compliance and encourage self-regulation or joint regulatory modes of operations. As part of this acuvity, the Director directs the continuing review of established HRDC regulations to ensure they do not create unnecessary barriers or inefficiencies and in cases where this is observed, leads the development of the uitegrated departmental response with the involved program officials. It is imperative that all proposed regulatory initiatives are authoritative, well researched and positioned, as they need to be sponsored by the Ministers betore the Special Committee of Council after clearing all government approval processes. The Director must ensure that all analyses and recommendations are of the highest quality and viability to ensure the smooth processing of these submissions and their acceptance by all involved DMs. the Special Committee and subsequently by officials and representatives of affected client. stakeholder and partner organizations. The Director directs ongoing liaison with the central agencies and Regulatory Affairs Committees and officials related to scheduling matters and the submission of HRDC business and agenda items, and to identify upcoming issues of concern to the Ministers and DMO requiring the development of departmental responses. The Parliamentary Aftairs business line is the next major sphere of operations for the Director. It is very similar in its mode of operations to the Cabinet and Regulatory Affairs activities but has its own sets of complications and priorities. Again the sheer scope of the HRDC policy and program priorities and the involvement of the Ministers and DMO in several Standing Committees of Parliament require the Director to develop within the organization a strong and strategic business capacity. The Director must be able to process several simultaneous issues and service demands for the Ministers Offices and DMO while ensuring the services and products are strategic, authoritative and have been screened and, where appropriate, challenged to ensure their value as credible and viable material and information for the use of the Ministers and DMO at these fora. Key functions of this Division are the: oversight and management of the HRDC support to the Ministers for their performance and participation in Question Period and the development of the required strategies, advisories and House Cards: the production of speeches and other matenal and strategies for the Ministers to effectively respond to enquiries 5
fhaman Resources and Skills Development Canada | ing Opposition Days in the House: directing the response to requests for information from Members of rarhament, Opposition Research Bureaus and the Library of Parliament: the conduct of proactive liaison with the Clerks of Process in the House of Commons regarding the proper approaches and protocols surrounding the Ministers proposed activities and initiatives; ensuring that Parliamentary Committees in general are monitored and that issues of possible interest or implications for the Ministers and DMO are identified, researched and brought to their attention with appropriate advisory services and options: and playing the lead departmental role tor the development of the strategies and activites to enhance and facilitate the passage of all HRDC legislation in the House. This last activity Is of obvious consequence for the department as the Director, ensures the coordination of required linkages and activities between HRDC and PCO, the Department of Justice and the House of Commons ( ., including the interfaces with the Office of Leader of the House) regarding the Strategies to enhance the legislauion s progress through the various phases of the approval process. The Director also directs this program in the development of a corporate tracking, coordination and internal reporting process to ensure that HRDC Is adequately represented at key interdepartmental meetings, the information presented is aligned with the positions of the DM and Ministers, and the knowledge gathered at such fora is analyzed and disseminated, as appropriate, across HRDC to enhance the service delivery capacity of all involved organizations In addition to the above four corporate Executive Services programs, the Director as part of his/her mandate is required to provide the same quality and level of support services to the Minister of Labour and SofS as that provided to the Minister of HRDC. This is accomplished by establishing the required degree of Ministerial coordination and haison support directly m these Offices. The Director needs to be sensitive to the political umplications of these Offices and determine strategies and approaches that link their business activities to the optimal degree with those of the Minister, HRDC, the DMO and the department. It is critical that services provided to these Ministers are consistent and cohesive with those provided to the Minister, HRDC and reflect the policy and program stances, positions and orientations of the department. The extra demands placed on the position by needing to service three Ministers all with active portfolios, and high public profile, are unparalleled tm simular positions across government. Mhe Director develops the policies, procedures and frameworks to govern the performance of the Division and its multi-faceted programs across HRDC and with the DMO and Ministers Offices. The Director continuously evaluates the pertormance of the Division to ensure itis providing the optimal service delivery and notes and lakes action to improve areas of perceived inefficiency or where comments have been received from involved senior executives. As well, the incumbent directs the research and development of innovative approaches to provide these services with new optics or non-traditional perspectives to best advance HRDC s positions and priorities and align them with those of the Ministers and DMO. To optimize the delivery of these critical corporate programs, it is essential that the Director develops strong cross-Branch horizontal linkages. This ensures important data and information trom all components of the Branch are incorporated in the Division s ongoing interfaces with the DMO and the Ministers and the provision of the required level of services in Briefings, Cabinet, Regulatory and Parliamentary Affairs. The Director provides professional leadership and management to the Division and develops its strategic and business plans and policy, procedural and service delivery frameworks. The incumbent ensures the development ofa work place culture that challenges and motivates staff while providing them with support and encouraging their professional development. The Director is a member of several Directorate and CAP Branch Committees, and contributes to the development and maintenance of these organizations overall policy and procedural frameworks, strategic and business plans and its management culture, guiding principles and ethics.

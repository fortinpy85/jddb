The Department employs a staff of approximately 3O,OOO situated at Headquarters and at the Service Canada regional offices, contact centres and in-person points of service across Canada. The Strategic & Service Policy Branch (SSPB) of ESDC integrates strategic and operational policy and service delivery across the Department. Its responsibilities include the development of economic, social and service strategic policies related to the mandate of the Department: research activities in these sectors; strategic planning and priorities; the coordination of Service Canada regional operations; the Innovation Lab; strategic management of data; programs evaluation; Cabinet affairs; intergovernmental and international relations; and policy development and program delivery related to Early Learning and Child Care. Within SSPB, the Sr. Director, Social Research Division supports all key ESDC social policy and program objectives and priorities and in this capacity, directs the provision of a comprehensive program of centralized social research services for clients across the ESDC, Service Canada and Labour Program Portfolio. This includes major research initiatives carried out at the direction of ESDC four Ministers and Deputy Ministers and on behalf of the Department's policy, program and service delivery branches including: the Income Security & Social Development Branch, Skills and Employment Branch, Learning Branch, Human Resources Branch, and Service Canada s Program Operations and Integrated Services Branches. The research work serves to inform and advance the Government of Canada s and the Department's social development priorities and strategic directions and as such, encompasses a wide range of highly- complex studies focused on Canada s changing demographics, trends/emerging issues affecting access to the labour market for disadvantaged individuals, and the socio-economic interests of families with children, seniors, persons with disabilities, the homeless, youth workers, early childhood educators, caregivers, the unemployed and other vulnerable groups of Canadian society. Other areas of critical research is focused on furthering the Department's social innovation agenda and exploring options for policy reforms to address societal challenges such as the increasing social equity concerns relating to education, employment, income, health and well-being. As the senior SPD social research lead, the Sr. Director works with a wide range of government and non- government partners and stakeholders to prioritize and align inter-related area of social research and to leverage the expertise of research specialists in various areas of social policy research relevant to the Department's national social development, labour program, and service delivery mandate. In particular, strong working relationships are maintained with Statistics Canada to expedite special surveys and statistical modelling in support departmental social development priorities with respect to income security, early learning, child care, poverty reduction, homelessness, disability and accessibility issues, etc. This includes research to assess the impact of federally-funded benefits such as the Canada Child Benefit Program in terms of reducing poverty for Canadians, as well as studies to determine the socio-economic impacts of Canada s aging population on the labour force and others. In addition, the Sr. Director leads SPD's participation in the collaborative work with the Income Security and Social Development Branch, the University of Montreal, Statistics Canada, the Office of the Chief Actuary of Canada, Finance Canada and other stakeholders on a major project to design, develop and maintain a large-scale Dynamic Micro-Simulation Population Model that will support ESDC's need for high quality information and projections in relation to retirement income with the initial focus to be on modelling the detailed social outcomes of the Canada Pension Plan. Further, the incumbent oversees a number of high-priority ESDC sponsored research studies carried out in partnership with the Work Integration Social Enterprise (WISE) groups which act as cooperatives to provide a range of social enterprise services and green occupations which are in demand in specific Sr. Director, Social Research July 5, 2O22 2
regions of Canada for example: in the North Simcoe county region of Ontario. This study, spanning five years (2OI8-22), will examine the effectiveness of the WISE in improving the employability and social inclusion of youth in rural communities. At the same time, it will assess changes in the capacity of social enterprises and examine variations in outcomes based on alternative models of work integration. As the ESDC senior social policy research lead, the Sr. Director works directly with the WISE groups involved, reports regularly to departmental officials on the progress/outcomes of each group, and through this work, directly influences the follow-on decision-making and policy development processes. Similarly, the incumbent works closely on research efforts with Indigenous & Northern Affairs Canada (INAC}, Immigration, Refugees & Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Statistics Canada, and the BC Centre for Employment Excellence (which is conducting an ESDC-sponsored five-year demonstration project to evaluate the role of the WISEs in supporting the labour market transitions of populations facing barriers that limit their career development potential). This project aims to provide transitional employment opportunities for different groups of vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities, immigrants, and Indigenous people. The pilot involves a series of case studies to provide a better understanding of WISE s capacity to serve job seekers facing barriers as well as the employment outcomes of participants who receive placements with the project's WISE partners. By combining research that examines both WISE capacity development and participant long-term employment outcomes, this study will provide ESDC with unique insights into the needs of the WISE groups who serve job seekers facing significant barriers to employment, as well as highlight the benefits that accrue to participants whom they employ. Ultimately this information will better inform and influence the Department's social policy agenda to increase opportunities and remove the barriers affecting the employment of vulnerable groups of Canadian society. The Sr. Director also chairs the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Social Development Research and Information (SDRI) and represents the Department in the joint work with the provinces and territories and First Nations to further social policy research initiatives. This includes both on and off- reserve research studies concerned with the identification of Indigenous persons with disabilities, accessibility and the workforce integration of Indigenous persons with disabilities. Other research partnerships are focused on Healthy and Productive Workplaces for persons with disabilities (in collaboration with the Social Science Humanities and Research Council and the Canadian Institute for Health Research), on data capacity building to support quantitative and qualitative analysis concerning the socio-economic conditions of different sub-populations (such as low income mothers or racialized Canadians), examining the impact of reverse mortgages on seniors, informing federal investment decisions as these relate to the creation of a universal Early Learning and Child Care system in Canada, as well as policy actions relating to pensioners, families, the economic security of LGBTQ seniors, etc. The Sr. Director represents the Department as chair/member of various international social policy research committees and working groups, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Social Policy which is concerned with social policy transformative change, the better integration of policy instruments, exploring inclusive forms of participation in social policy design and implementation, new forms of partnership and directions in social policy development and social innovation etc. The incumbent also works directly with the Chief Statistician on research supporting the work of the OECD Well-being, Inclusion, Sustainability and Social Inclusion (WISE) Centre. In addition, the Sr. Director directs the preparation of the Division's resource forecasts, strategic planning documents, as well as a wide range of Treasury Board submissions, high-level briefing materials and other documents related to numerous research initiatives such as the Dynamic Microsimulation Initiative. As an illustration, this includes leading the work of the coordinating committee of the initiative, preparing materials for meetings of the Assistant Deputy Ministers interdepartmental steering committee, and supporting the participation of the Ministers and Deputy Ministers in Federal-Provincial-Territorial meetings and multilateral forums, such as the OECD, UN, Economic Summits, etc. Major challenges of the position include the significant outreach and strong communications skills needed to forge strategic partnerships, build trust, and secure the cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders in order to further the Department's social research agenda. This involves significant and ongoing contact Sr. Director, Social Research July 5, 2O22 3

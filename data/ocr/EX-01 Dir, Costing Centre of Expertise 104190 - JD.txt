Nature and scope ESDC, which includes Service Canada and the Canada Labour program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. Overseen by five federal Ministers, the Department operates under the direction of the Deputy Head and Deputy Minister, ESDC; the Deputy Minister of Labour and Associate Deputy Minister, ESDC; the Senior Associate Deputy Minister ESDC who is also the Chief Operating Officer of Service Canada; the Senior Associate Deputy Minister, ESDC; the Associate Deputy Minister, ESDC; and the Chief Transformation Officer. ESDC designs and delivers a number of high priority Government of Canada programs that provide benefits for Canadians, including the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, Canada Student Loans and Grants, Canada Apprentice Loans Program, Canada Education Savings Program, the Wage Earner Protection Program, Canada Disability Savings Program, Federal Workers Compensation, and as well as special benefits programs as required by unexpected hardship. ESDC s non-budgetary authorities consist of loans disbursed under the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act and the Apprentice Loans Act. The Department also delivers programs and services on behalf of other departments and agencies, such as Passport services for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and for veterans on behalf of Veterans Director, Costing Centre of Expertise Page 3 of 9 June I%, 2O23
Affairs Canada. The Department s budget as it appears in the Main Estimates is approximately $87B, while Planned Spending, as outlined in the Departmental Plan, is almost $I74B for 2O22- 23. ESDC has a complex financial structure with various funding mechanisms used to deliver its mandate. Funding of the Department s national benefits services delivery network is also one of the largest resource allocations in government involving more than 6OO points of service across Canada. This includes some 3I7 in-person Service Canada centres, 247 scheduled out- reach locations, 24 Government of Canada passport offices, as well as Service Canada s Specialized Call Centres and online services channels. As the face of the federal government for many Canadians, ESDC plays an integral role in government-wide initiatives to improve service results and offer a seamless service experience. As the service delivery landscape shifts with rapid advancements in technology, Canadians increasingly expect easy-to-access, simple and secure services, and ESDC has developed a transformation plan that serves as the roadmap for the transformation and modernization of ESDC s services and advances its vision for improved service delivery. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer (DCFO) and Director General, Corporate Financial Planning is accountable for: leading and directing ESDC s corporate financial planning and management function; providing expert financial advice, briefings and recommendations to departmental leaders/decision-makers and assurances to the CFO and Deputy Ministers regarding the robust management, oversight and reporting of ESDC funding authorities and Estimates including advice to senior management and Ministers on Parliamentary Committees; overseeing the development and maintenance of ESDC s Costing Framework; overseeing the oversight and delivery of the TB Submission Control Framework; ensuring the integrity of the financial component of all departmental funding proposals and submissions to Cabinet and Treasury Board, and ensuring the alignment of departmental funding proposals/submissions with broader departmental and government-wide strategic directions and priorities. In this context, the DCFO/Director General, Corporate Financial Planning Directorate, is accountable for leading and directing the development and maintenance of ESDC s financial planning and external reporting frameworks, and for the strategic leadership, management and oversight of the department's funding authorities and expenditures. The Directorate serves as the corporate authority in ensuring that frameworks enable the management of expenditures from several different sources. This is challenging given the complexities created by the Department's multiple sources of funds: appropriations, Employment Insurance Operating Account, Canada Pension Plan Account, and other revenues. The Directorate oversees the management of the source of funds and is accountable for the accuracy of calculations from an administrative perspective. As such, the DCFO/Director General is the lead on the charging of administrative costs to the respective accounts (CRF, El, CPP) and directs the development of the carry-forward calculation for TBS approval. The Directorate provides expert advice to the Chief Financial Officer and other senior management including the Deputy Minister of ESDC, the COO of Service Canada and the Deputy Minister of Labour, advising on the management of Department's funds from multiple sources Director, Costing Centre of Expertise Page 4 of 9 June I%, 2O23
and on the development and management of the departmental budget and the overall budget cycle. The Director Costing Centre of Expertise is accountable for diligent oversight and management of ESDC s Costing Framework and supporting policies and reinforces the Directorate s role as a centre of expertise in liaising with TBS to assure consistency of the approach across the Department. The incumbent directs the development of costing standards, tools, and relevant communications to safeguard ESDC s compliance with financial policies, including the TB Guide to Costing. The incumbent must be confident that key assumptions are reliable, including estimates relative to workload and costs. The Director provides strategic recommendations to the DG regarding promotion and department-wide implementation of the TB Guide to Costing is instrumental in supporting the advancement of stewardship, accountability, and value for money. In support of the Comptroller General of Canada s priority to strengthen the Government of Canada s capacity to manage and deliver projects successfully, the Director promotes and leads a credible cost estimating process and FMA attestation process that are evidence-based and data driven in support of decision-making by ensuring the documentation is accurate, relevant, timely, and interpretable. As the lead costing expert for ESDC, the Director is responsible for providing authoritative advice and guidance regarding new projects requiring cost estimates for TB submissions and Memoranda to Cabinet. Another major role is directing the team in performing the complex calculation and analysis of the administration costs chargeable to the CPP Account. This Account has expenditures of over $52 billion annually to CPP recipients. Recent changes to the CPP legislation have increased the complexity factor as all Canadian employees will now contribute more to the CPP, and in return, receive more later in life. Given that these increased benefits will start incrementally, with full increased results expected in 2O65, the Director is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the reasonableness of the expenditure attribution of administration costs to be charged to the CPP Account. As such, the Director has the responsibility for developing the financial management terms of the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between ESDC and the Canada Pension Plan which is a separate organizational entity. As ESDC is the steward for the Canada Pension Plan, it has a responsibility for defining all direct expenditures linked to administration of the CPP, and as such, must define the direct costs to be charged to the CPP account for its administration. This represents a constant challenge for the Director as the MOU is extremely complex (over 9O pages) and must be revised on an annual basis. While a significant part of the costing challenges associated with the CPP MOU involves defining direct ESDC costs in delivering the CPP (e.g. accounting; Service Canada charges; policy work; processing CPP payments; ESDC Call Centre services; etc.), the Director must also ensure that other governmental costs with direct links to CPP administration are covered in the MOU, such as PSPC charges for cheque issuance, CRA charges for contribution payments, etc. Given the high profile and scrutiny relating to CPP administration, the Director must ensure that the costing dimensions of CPP administration accurately reflect all direct expenditures. Director, Costing Centre of Expertise Page 5 of 9 June I%, 2O23
A continuing responsibility and challenge for the Director lies in developing the overall Cost Structure for ESDC, while also providing the overall corporate analysis and categorization of all costs across the department, which represents $I7OB in expenditures. The incumbent ensures departmental expertise in developing the cost allocation methodology used by the department to recover costs from the El Operating Account ($I.98), the CPP Accounts ($558.5M), and the Service Delivery Partnerships under the DESDA Act ($252.IM) to ensure proper financial reporting of the department s four main sources of funds. As part of this key role, the incumbent must provide leadership to trend analysis in departmental costs, the identification of cost increases, reductions and related key factors, as well as noted costing problems. The Director has responsibility for ad hoc costing reports for the department, as well as briefing and advising the CFO and ADM on all aspects related to corporate cost analyses. The incumbent plays a central role in providing analysis, advice and recommendations to senior management in relation to government strategic reviews, and potential cost reductions linked to departmental spending. It is within this context that the Director Costing Centre of Expertise is accountable for leading a team of I3 highly trained FI specialists in supporting the effective oversight and management of the department's costing framework and supporting policies, strengthening the department s project management framework through collaboration with the Department s executive management, and ensuring key assumptions for resource acquisition, including estimates relative to workload and all other costs, are reliable. The Director is responsible for coordinating the provision of strategic oversight, and management of cost information that is intended to support ongoing internal decision making by ensuring cost information is reliable, accurate, tailored to management s information and decision support needs, and prepared in accordance with the Treasury Board guidelines. This includes periodic reviews of corporate cost calculations used for all departmental costing requirements such as Budget proposals, MCs, TB submissions and investment proposals, whether they are seeking access to new and renewal funding or required to provide supporting financial information going through gating, stages, phases or tranches of the projects and programme governing framework. Given the diversity, complexity and considerable public funding of the programs and services delivered by ESDC, as well as the political environment that largely influences changes in programs, services and related funding, there is a critical requirement for ensuring that decisions are supported by sound financial costing. Additionally, the context of continued modernization of government programs and services results in major reform initiatives and transformation projects that have considerable financial implications for the department. The Director therefore plays a key and major role in managing the continued development, advancement and review of the comprehensive costing frameworks, policies, standards, systems and tools that are necessary, not only in guiding the cost estimating of evolving programmes and projects, but also to provide the specialized tools and guidance needed to improve and ensure greater cost efficiency in delivering ESDC s programs and projects. For example, the Director is accountable for providing the oversight of programme/project management costing for significant multi-year, multi-million dollar transformational departmental programmes, which include Benefits Delivery Modernization, Human Resources Modernization and Data Foundation. Other examples of significant multi-year, multi-million Director, Costing Centre of Expertise Page 6 of 9 June I%, 2O23
dollar projects include the Canada Pension Plan Enhancement, Canada Pension Plan Service Improvement Strategy and Network Modernization Stream 3. The considerable funding implications from such programmes and projects require that the Director play a central role in defining the various costing dimensions related to their financial planning and delivery, and ensuring the delivery of authoritative costing advice and guidance in supporting the work of corporate management, financial management and Investment, Procurement and Project Management colleagues. A continuing major challenge for the Director is to ensure that ESDC s costing frameworks remain accurate and reflect changes in programs, services and projects, requiring that costing processes be adjusted on an annual basis. The incumbent plays a central role in the development of ESDC s Resource Determination Model (RDM) ratios, and requires providing direction in the conceptualization and necessary modifications to the specific costing models that apply to each of Service Canada s five (5) business lines. The Director ensures oversight to the team s costing analysis associated with all business line work activity costs, which serve to support each business line s access to funding for their service delivery requirements. In directing the delivery of this costing expertise, the Director must ensure that all work activities are represented in RDMs, that such models are based on industry standards, and that ratios used are correct or require adjustments. The incumbent is also responsible for keeping up to date, reviewing and advising on innovations and new technologies like automation and data analytics that could be implemented to enhance any financial process related to cost estimating or reporting like the Salary Forecasting Tool. The Director is a member of the Branch management team and contributes to the overall management of the Branch and to its overarching policy and service delivery frameworks. The incumbent is responsible for establishing the Directorate s business processes and for managing its financial resources with probity and according to all principles of modern comptrollership. In a context of a modern management, the Director would also be called upon to create and foster a quality work environment characterized by transparent and collaborative management, diversity and inclusion, continuous learning and respect for individuals. Working conditions Psychological The work environment is characterized by significant and acute pressures and heavy workloads. The work requires dealing with conflicting issues and priorities, multiple demands, time pressures, shifting priorities and deadlines which may lead to a lack of control over one's agenda. There is a requirement to provide advice on sensitive, complex and emotionally-driven and politically- charged issues, which may result in stress and fatigue. The workday is structured though unpredictable circumstances frequently arise that require the reorganization of planned activities. Director, Costing Centre of Expertise Page 7 of 9 June I%, 2O23
Physical The work is generally conducted in an office setting and is characterized by desk work, requiring sitting for prolonged periods of time while attending meetings, presentations and briefings, negotiations, consultations, or when conducting analysis or when reviewing documents, requiring constant focus, concentration and attention. Regularly views computer screens and reads and reviews documents for prolonged periods requiring extensive visual effort. Occasional travel is required often outside business hours for meetings beyond the local time zone. Consequently, jet lag and fatigue may be experienced in the conduct of affairs while travelling.

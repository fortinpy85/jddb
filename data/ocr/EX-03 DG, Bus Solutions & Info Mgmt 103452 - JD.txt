NATURE AND SCOPE The Department of Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) was formed by the merger of 5 different departments in I993. The merger required the integration of a wide variety of infrastructure technology, through interfaces and other bridging mechanisms. Today, providing integrated rapid services to citizens requires seamless service across many technology platforms. Maintaining the old infrastructure is costly and inefficient, and will prevent HRDC from moving to more cost effective, integrated services. The |-volution initiative, begun in 2OOO-OI, is intended to modernize the technology infrastructure of the department as a necessary prerequisite to the transition to modemized service delivery, and an important ongoing responsibility to maximize interoperability and efficiency. Modemizing Service for Canadians (MSC) required the Systems Branch to undertake a new kind of role and leadership with respect to the design, organization, protection and sharing of strategic client information. The Branch needs to understand the information and knowledge management requirements of the department as the drivers of the Systems design and implementation. The Branch s role also needs to encompass services ranging from the definition, integration and analysis of common information and knowledge requirements of different Program Branches to, in collaboration with the Program and Human Resources Branches, understanding and facilitating workforce changes that result from Systems changes. The Systems Branch must continually work towards improving its service delivery to internal and external clients, partners and stakeholders and the general public. In moving to modemize service to Canadians, all HRDC components must work as a team to overcome some of the issues that remain as a result of the early integration of departments. It is essential for the systems Branch to build strong governance and collaboration mechanisms which enable regional, program and Systems staff to work effectively together to make the essential transition and achieve the objectives of MSC. As a result, the Client Solutions Division led by the Chief, Client Solutions Officer (CCSO) established to ensure cost-effective development and implementation of HRDC s IT services and applications to all internal and external clients. Within that context, the Chief Client Solutions Officer (CCSO) is responsible for developing and implementing the frameworks, strategies and policies related to the maintenance of legacy systems, the development of new applications and the introduction of and migration to new technologies and platforms which will enable HRDC to meet the objectives and needs of its varied clientele which includes the general public, other departments and other levels of government in the following four (4) key applications areas: HRI systems, ISP systems, INLS systems and Corporate systems. The CCSO directs the brokering of these services throughout the department to provide 82532 CHIEFCLISOLOFF.DOC Revised O2.O6.24 Page 2 of 5
HRDC with the high-quality state-of-the-art automated systems, applications and services required to support departmental business lines and the achievement of corporate goals and objectives concerning the use of technology as a program delivery and service enhancement tool. This requires the incumbent to develop strategies and plans to ensure that application, products and services meet client requirements and support their efforts to promote the introduction, enhancement and advancement of electronic commerce and business process re-engineering for the delivery of HRDC programs to the Canadian population. He/she is required to develop the approaches and methodologies to ensure that new and/or revised systems are secure and technically sound with respect to all delivery components. The CCSO directs the development and coordinates the implementation of the operating plans required to deliver the applications products and services outlined in the Systems Branch business plan. The incumbent coordinates the technical and supplier research in support of the development, implementation, introduction and maintenance of new applications and services. The CCSO is responsible for ensuring that the Systems Branch is aware of technology emerging developments and trends, and is provided with the necessary analysis to make the proper business decisions that minimize risk and provide the best value to HRDC and the Government of Canada. The CCSO ensures that approaches and methodologies related to HRDC systems and applications requirements are in place to identify technological opportunities which can support departmental business lines, activities, products and strategies. The key strategy for the Systems Application Sector in providing applications products and services to departments/clients is to ensure that integrated business solutions are developed and that they are customized to the specific needs of the client and/or program. The CCSO directs the development and implementation of strategies, approaches and methodologies to analyze and determine the current status of available technologies, their maturity and their applicability to the HRDC environment. The CCSO is responsible for negotiating and obtaining the agreement of the Chief Technology Officer and program and business areas clients with such issues as the development and use of business and data models, equipment compatibility, architectural choice etc. so that applications developed are accessible to and supportive to the maximum number of program/functional areas of clients. He/she is also responsible for ensuring that all technological developments are consistent with and integrated into the Treasury Board/Chief Information Officer function, particularly as they relate to the federal architecture with respect to application development. The CCSO is responsible for ensuring that his/her organization has the capacity to provide all the engineering expertise required for service modifications and enhancements and that all service modifications and enhancements are implemented according to agreed time and cost schedules. One of the key challenges for the CCSO is to ensure that strategies and plans are developed in support of the Government On Line Program to allow HRDC to link to the 82532 CHIEFCLISOLOFF.DOC Revised O2.O6.24 Page 3 of 5
secure federal government channel to be provided by a consortium of private sector companies and, thereby, enhance inter-connectivity and provide secure Internet capabilities for all departmental services. The CCSO directs the development and implementation of remote access and secure messaging services using fire wall technologies for the transfer of computer applications amongst federal government departments and agencies. The work requires a broad knowledge of systems and applications engineering theories and principles as well as general management theories and principles. The CCSO must be able to reconcile the mission, strategic direction, mandate and operating principles of HRDC with the evolving approaches and strategies of the central agencies and its clients as well as the federal government in relation to the use of technology in delivering services to the Canadian public. As a result, the CCSO maintains regular contacts with senior managers in other federal government departments and agencies in order to discuss and develop strategic approaches to the development of systems and applications for the delivery of government programs and services. Similarly, the CCSO is in contact with officials of the office of the Chief Information Officer at Treasury Board to discuss strategies and initiatives for government wide applications of models and applications developed by HRDC. Finally, the CCSO is a member of the Systems Branch Management Committees. There is thus a need to take a corporate-wide view of issues to be addressed. He/she brings strategic advice and expertise to the deliberations of the Management Committee in relation to government-wide corporate initiatives in relation to services delivery applications and systems. Many of these issues must be debated within the context of the need to remain a leader among federal government departments and agencies for the development of program and service delivery. As a result the CCSO requires strong leadership and human management skills to direct the work of a large work force through subordinate managers at the Director General level as well as a thorough knowledge of government and business financial planning and control systems and mechanisms to manage a multi million dollar budget.

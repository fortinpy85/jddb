Nature and Scope ESDC's mission is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that heip them live productive and rewarding lives, and to improve Canadians quality of life. To do this, ESDC: - Deveiops policies that make Canada a society in which all can use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community; . - Creates programs and support initiatives that help Canadians move through life's transitions from families with children to seniors, from school to work, from one job to another, from i unemployment to employment, from the workforce to retirement, and: - Creates better outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. The ESDC Portfolio consists of ESDC, Service Canada, and Labour Canada. The portfolio has over 23,OOO employees, with an operating budget of over $2.5 billion. This includes upwards of $5OO million annually in investments across major assets (IT and I property) and transformation management. These investments are central to the Service ; Delivery Agenda of the Government of Canada and the establishment of a single window i _ access model for multi-jurisdictional service delivery for Canadians. More specifically, the Executive Director is responsible for establishing the investment/capitai plan with a sound \ approach to providing a sound set of well informed choices for budget related decision making | and approval processes for maintaining the Department's nationwide asset infrastructure. The Executive Director's accountabilities operate in support of a diverse set of business lines | from legislative and policy development in the domains of social and labor market policy, to | service delivery for over $75 billion in benefits to Canadians and an additional $35 billion in | 2
various forms of statutory and voted grants and contributions. The ESDC portfolio acts as a Passports receipt agent for Passport Canada. The Executive Director oversees the development and process management of large contracts (under $2 million) for Consultants, project management and research services including the development of submissions for the approval of the Major Projects Investment Board (MPIB). The Executive Director is responsible for the supporting and delivering procurement services on an annual business volume of approximately $35Om in support of Department programs and projects. The Executive Director ensures investment planning is founded in an effective regime for planning, decision making, and governance so that the Department manages investments to consistently address its highest priorities and greatest risks to the government. This role is an essential component of the governance of the ESDC portfolio, most notably in the work of the ADM (MPIB) and the Deputy level Portfolio Management Board. The Executive Director also ensures that the management of projects is well addressed in the ESDC portfolio. The Executive Director provides for a comprehensive approach to managing projects, appropriate to the level of project risk and complexity, key to increasing the likelihood of realizing project outcomes. This includes ensuring that: accountability for outcomes is clear; appropriate controls are in place to minimize risk and limit project duplication and overiap; key project stakeholders are consulted; and outputs and outcomes are monitored and reported. These responsibilities are executed through support to the oversight role played by MPIB and the analytical support to that committee by the senior analyst led teams for investments and for project management. More specifically the role includes ensuring that a Department-wide governance and oversight mechanism is in place, documented and maintained. The mechanism is used to manage the { initiation, planning, execution, control, and closing of projects. This mechanism also ensures that opportunities are considered for integrating projects across the Department and the Government of Canada. In ESDC this is referred to as the Stage Gate process managed through MPIB. The key products of the Executive Director s work include establishing the Departmental investment plan and portfolio management of the Department's projects. ; The Executive Director is responsible for the development and annual updating of the five year Investment Plan which is aligned to Departmental priorities and is essential to the : transformation of the portfolio s major operations and its core processes. Within these investments will be the fundamental transformation of the Departmental infrastructure and the development of new operating models. The Executive Director is responsible for the provision of oversight of the development, evaluation and continuing refinement of the Portfolio's strategies, policies, control frameworks, processes and tools for Project Management; supporting the Investment Planning process; the provision of leadership and direction over the modemization, streamlining and delivery of the Portfolio's procurement operations; the integration of procurement operations with project management and for improvement of Portfolio Capacity building in both project management and procurement. A major challenge for the Executive Director is that of optimizing project selection. There are considerably more worthwhile projects proposed than there are available funds, placing a premium on criteria to assess project complexity, risks, and criticality. This is further 3
complicated by project interdependency. The criteria are amended annually to reflect lessons teamed, assessments of the viability and reliability of the criteria, and analyses of performance. A related challenge is dealing with the dichotomy in project management. Project management is the responsibility of the sponsoring organization: the division is responsible for the effectiveness and efficiency of processes and review and oversight functions. The division is the Department's centre of excellence on project management and provides expertise on the development and shaping of proposals, the application of project management principles, and on the development of supporting analyses and documentation such as opportunities and options analysis and business cases. The challenges faced in procurement include: ensuring the success of the procurement model: improving effectiveness through use of strategic tools such as commodity management and strategic sourcing; effective quality assurance; and risk management. The Executive Director must continually monitor business volumes, risks, service level standards, and complexities and determine the need for temporary and permanent realignments. The Executive Director provides leadership and direction over the design, development and implementation of the quality assurance program and related procedures and processes; the early identification of procurement risks and the development and implementation of risk mitigation strategies. The quality assurance program feeds back into the development and implementation of risk mitigation strategies, tactical changes in procedures and processes, tools for the use of managers, and capability building processes. The Executive Director identifies and ranks risk factors, identifies complex procurement requirements which are risk sensitive, and develops risk avoidance and mitigation strategies. Risk management strategies employed by the position are: heavy concentration and monitoring of the procurement evaluation phase; the introduction of a quality assurance program; hiring an independent fairness monitor on particularly complex procurements; and identifying potential legal issues and seeking a legal opinion. The position's risk management activities are critical in ensuring effective procurement. ! The Executive Director provides effective procurement solutions to senior managers to aid them in meeting their timelines and meeting business objectives and priorities, This includes i engaging clients when they are planning an initiative which requires procurement to ensure : early identification of procurement needs and risks and development of procurement : strategies; and advising on alternate solutions when the client is proposing a course of action : which would place their contract at risk or would create spillover risks which would impact on | other projects or contracts. i An additional procurement challenge is that of coping with the profusion of new policies and i tools from the central agency but the Department has to be positioned to deal with them. . Among the changes which have taken place are the requirement for proactive disclosure, including one to provide reports on contracts awarded to former public servants in receipt of a pension; an increase in the number of tools for National Master Standing Offers and Supply Arrangements; and a change in the authorities delegated to departments. Another challenge is that of developing the Department's case for challenges before the independent bodies of the Procurement Ombudsman and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT). Challenge before the Procurement Ombudsman typically involves IT 4
procurement and is highly contentious. The CITT is responsible for dealing with challenges under a variety of International Trade Agreements, including NAFTA. The Executive Director works with legal services on case development, advises senior management on options, and may be required to appear as an expert witness at hearings. F The Executive Director is also responsible for developing action plans to address findings of MAF assessments, audit reports, monitoring reports and evaluations and monitoring the implementation of these action plans. Capacity building is a challenge common to project management and procurement. In project management, the Executive Director develops and implements capacity building strategies, develops and disseminates specialized tools, and oversees the delivery of information sessions and the provision of communications materials. The Executive Director identifies special Departmental and subject matter needs and develops statements of work. Improving proficiency in procurement of managers and administrative professionals is also critical, particularly in the areas of planning, definition and evaluation of technical requirements, development of statements of work, and vendor/contractor management. The position oversees the development of templates, tools, and sample documents. The Executive Director is responsible for ensuring the validity of project complexity and risk assessments and the quality and integrity of supporting documentation. The Executive Director has regular contacts with the chairs of the governance bodies: e.g., MPIB, project sponsors, project directors and executives, senior managers respecting procurement issues, senior officials in other enabler groups such as the ClO, CFO, Strategic Planning, Corporate Planning, and HRB, and with Legal Services. Externally, there are regular contacts with executives of TBS, senior officials in PWGSC, and with counterparts in other departments to share ideas, experiences, and best practices. The Executive Director is a member of the Treasury Board Project Management Advisory Committee, various departmental major Project Steering Committees, and senior level Steering Committees on large contracts. The position also makes presentations to the Corporate Management Committee, responds to their challenge, and persuades them to buy into proposals. The Executive Director is also a key member of the Directorate Management Committee. : Dimensions FTEs: 36. Budget: $3.6 million. Annual value of procurement: $29O million.

Nature and Scope ; The Government of Canada is committed to helping create a more inclusive and innovative environment for all Canadians. The Government and Parliament have given Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) a mandate to help achieve these goals. Under that mandate, HRDC assists millions of Cansdians exch year. Canadians of all ages (children, youth, working age adults, seniors) as well as those with distinct needs (Aboriginal people, Canadians with disabilities, homeless Canadians and others). The Communications Branch of HRDC has not had a major examination and realignment since the department was established in I993. Since that time there have been several major evolutions in the operational environment and context of the department. These require new, innovative and strategic communications responses and service delivery orientations and directions from the Branch. The department has increasingly moved to the center of the government's overall policy agenda due to the sheer scope and impact of its programming (i.c., thirty nine cents of every dollar of federal expenditures are invested in people through the Department and over eleven million people benefit from one or more of HRDC s services every year). Evolving working and partnering relationships with the provinces have also raised HRDC s profile and prominence in the center of government strategies and operations. This core importance of HRDC was further entrenched by the signing of new federal provincial accords such as the Social and Economic Union Agreements, new Labour Market Development Agreements, etc. Recent federal government policy initiatives including skills and learning, youth employment, children at risk, social inclusion of the disadvantaged and marginalized, homelessness, family and community development, etc., all involve the department as the primary federal delivery agent and again raise its governmental and public profile. wie As well as these major federal initigtives and shifts, there are growing expectations and demands on the department from its wide range of clicnt, stakeholder and partner constituencies and a myried of central agency corporate managemeat initiatives to which HRDC must respond and show effective leadership. All of these factors require the strongest and most proactive Communications support from HRDC and in tum for the Minister, HRDC, the Minister Labour, the Secretary of State for Aboriginal and Youth, and the large senior management cadre across HRDC (i. ., 27 positions at the ADM or higher levels alone). These services are essential to.attain the highest and most positive profile for HRDC and to gain the confidence and support of Canadians. for the level of services delivered by it and for the effectiveness and efficiency of its management of the largest single federal expenditure portfolio (i.c., over $6O billion). . In this context, the Director, Internal Communications is responsible for the leadership and ongoing
TT N E'=MC S: C~CO ts Management of the Internal Communications function for the Branch and HRDC s department-wide Communications program. This in itself is a major challenge, given the wide range of NHQ policy and program portfolios, and the perspectives, requirements and service delivery responsibilities of the Regions. The Director must display leadership and Communications expertise to achieve a consensus on the overarching priorities for the Branch s and HRDC s department-wide Intemal Communications plan. Great attention must be paid to ensure this plan reflects the major priorities of the Government of ! Canada for HRDC and embodies HRDC's key corporate strategic and business priorities, including those of the Ministers, Secretary of State and senior management. This requires strategic positioning and negotiation by the Director through bi-lateral and multi-lateral mectings and discussions to gain the understanding and agreement of all parties and their commitment to abide by, and support the implementation of, HRDC s Internal Communications Plan and Framework. The Director must establish the frameworks, processes and linkages to institutionalize within HRDC an effective Internal Communications prog am that acts as the conduit of corporate messages to managers and staff across the department and also allows them to contribute to, and comment on, corporate messages affecting the workforce and workplace. The program will act as an enabling mechanism as it will provide staff with key corporate HRDC directions, decisions and orientations of the Executive Offices and various Corporate Committees. Similarly, the program will select and disseminate key decisions taken at various Cabinet and Parliamentary meetings and other extemal DM and ADM level meetings which impact.in. significant way on tho department. In this way the Director will ensure the workforce has a wider range of information, which reflects developments in the department s total intemal and extemal operating environment, to assist managers and staff in developing their own strategies and activities to cope with new policy, program and service delivery orientations. In performing this role the Director ig in regular contact with the DMO, MOs, Corporate Committees and other HRDC executives to assist them in determining the best way to position messages in order to obtain the optimum reception and understanding by general and specific audiences of managers and staff across HRDC. The Internal Communications program..also. includes all HRDC Intranet activities, as this will increasingly become the preferred medium for the transmission of corporate messages across the department. As a result, the Director Internal Communications has also been given the accountability for setting the policy and procedural frameworks governing the levels of quality, preseatation and formats for the Intranet end for the management of the corporate HRDC intranet website. The Internal Communications program is an integral part of HRDC s corporate communications strategy. A challenge for the Director is to maintain the renewed emphasis in the new Government af Canada Communications Policy on intemal communications. This renewed emphasis stresses the need to foster employee knowledge, awareness and understanding and that internal communication must be a two-way dialogue engaging employees in a conversation for action allowing HRDC to tap | into a vast pool of intelligence and expertise. Internal communication activities and processes must be | reviewed from time to time to evaluate results, to identify areas for improvement and to make adjustments as required. A key challenge for the Director, in the design and implementation of the Internal Communications program, is to ensure the development and oversight of strategies to raise the awareness of all levels of management to the fact that communications is a key management element thst can result in tremendous bencfits if properly conceptualized, planned, developed and delivered. The Director, Internal Communications acts as a major corporate change agent for HRDC.

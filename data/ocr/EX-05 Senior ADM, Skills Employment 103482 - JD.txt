NATURE AND SCOPE The mission of Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) is to build a stronger and more competitive workforce, to support Canadians in making choices that enable them to live productive and rewarding lives and to improve the quality of life of Canadians. The mission is accomplished through the development and delivery of policies and programs to promote a society in which all Canadians are able to use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community. HRSDC also creates programs and supports initiatives to support Canadians to move through life's transitions and creates enhanced outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners. As both a policy and program centre, HRSDC is accountable for the development and implementation of policies, strategies, frameworks and initiatives that integrate and harmonize the mandates of three organization entities at the corporate level. This corporate leadership and coordination role ensures the Ministers, Secretary of State, Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are provided with considered and consistent advice that represents the collective views of HRSDC, Labour Canada and Service Canada. The Minister, HRSDC is supported by three Deputy Heads: HRSDC, Labour Canada and Service Canada. HRSOC is responsible for policy and program development and delivery, Labour Canada promotes a fair, safe, healthy, stable, cooperative and productive work environment and Service Canada is the delivery arm of Government programs, services and benefits. The combined HRSDC and Labour Canada workforce is thirty-five hundred and Service Canada has an additional twenty-seven thousand employees. Service Canada is located in all regions of the Country through which some of the programs and services of HRSDC, as weil as those of other departments and agencies, are made available to Canadians in person, by telephone or through the Internet. HRSD operates in a complex governance and accountability structure as it supports two Ministers, two Parliamentary Secretaries; a Deputy Minister and two Associate Deputy Ministers and has complex interfaces for service delivery to Canadians and shared corporate services through the Service Canada Initiative. It is within this context that the Senior ADM, Skills and Employment is responsible for directing the development of the Branch s strategic and business goals, objectives and priorities, ensuring their adherence to the strategic vision and mission statements of HRSDC, the priorities of the Ministers and Deputy and Associate Deputy Ministers and the federal government's overarching policy agenda with respect to the creation of a high participation, high quality economy, and highly efficient and productive labour market. The SADM must ensure that branch policy and programming responses address the challenges of the Speech from the Throne and other federal and departmental priorities while also ensuring that branch planning, accountability, performance measurement and reporting frameworks and practices are fully congruent with and supportive of central agency and HRSDC policies and directives. These are large and complex challenges, combining those associated with setting the corporate and cultural direction for the Branch, as well as those inherent in aligning the Branch within the SADM, Skills and Emplovment 4 September 24. 2OO7
Human Resources and Social Development Canada vroad priorities, strategies and socio- economic directions of Cabinet and the federal government's overarching policy agenda with respect to the creation of a high participation, high quality, and highly productive and efficient labour market. To place the responsibilities of the SADM within a more easily understood frame of reference, he/she manages a Branch with a resource base of more than 55O FTEs, with an annual budget (including Grants & Contributions) in excess of $55O million. From a management perspective, one of the key challenges faced by the SADM is to lead the ongoing development of the Branch s culture and its overarching vision and mission which are essential in order for the Branch to meet its many program policy and design challenges. He/She must create the sense of teamwork required to integrate to the greatest degree the many diverse and formerly independent portfolios within the Branch s mandate. This requires developing and implementing the appropriate structures, resource allocations and skills deployment across the Branch and working to engage managers and staff in contributing to the new Branch 's priorities, and to its business planning. In performing these activities the SADM ensures the reflection and incorporation of the corporate HRSDC Vision and Mission statements and the priorities of Cabinet, the Minister and DM as well as the senior Corporate Committees and the Management Board. The Branch operates in a complex, multi-jurisdictional/stakeholder environment in which consistent and credible management information is of the highest importance, especially during the current transition period as the new departmental structures are being introduced. The S/ADM, by ensuring the use of effective management and governance tools (e.g. operational policies, interpretations, reporting systems) provides direction to regional and NHQ management on the implementation of effective program management frameworks Given the complexities of the HRSDC overall composition and structures, a significant challenge for the SADM is to ensure that branch governance frameworks and mechanisms not only facilitate both efficient and effective decision making within the Branch but also contribute to horizontal policy and operational integration and consistency across the entire Department. This requires extensive consultation, negotiation and consensus building with the Offices of the Ministers, Deputy and Associate Deputy Ministers, other Assistant Deputy Ministers, Service Canada officials and shared service corporate functional Branches. The complexity is increased as the new governance processes and frameworks must be responsive to current central agency and HRSDC imperatives such as: modern management and comptrollership; enhanced accountability, evaluation and reporting within HRSDC, the government and to Parliament and the Canadian public; enhanced programming which integrates to the greatest degree all HRSDC and whenever possible federal programming; reduction of duplication with programs provided by other levels of government or third parties; and the emphasis on strong internal horizontal linkages to enhance data sharing and decision-making and to break down the traditional, vertical service delivery models that characterized former departmental program operations. This renewal is also required to demonstrate that the Department is taking serious action to ensure that appropriate control frameworks exist for the delivery of Grants and Contributions. This is critical to meet the scrutiny of the central agencies, all levels of government, the Canadian public-at-large and the media. These drivers emphasize the need for the ADM to establish strong governance frameworks for the Branch especially for its impact on public funding allocations and appropriations. The policy and program responsibilities of the Senior Assistant Deputy Minister are indeed significant. He/she directs the development of substantive policy and program frameworks, policy and program design proposals, including federal-provincial/territorial program SADM, Skills and Employment 5 September 24, 2OO7
Human Resources and Social Development Canada frameworks, with respect to the Employment Insurance program and all other Skills and Employment programs. The incumbent oversees the development of strategy and policy advice on Part | of the Employment Insurance program for the Minister and government and provides the corporate and strategic context with respect to the initiation and direction of a range of program policy activities, including the research, analysis, development and design of program policies, instruments and frameworks, adjustment strategies/emergency measures, and pilot projects as well as the preparation of legislative and regulatory policy measures. A key element of the S/ADM s leadership role is identifying the need for and developing major new program policy initiatives, and leading the development of related Memoranda to Cabinet and Treasury Board Submissions, legislative amendments and, as required, Orders-in Council for required program changes. As the official responsible for the El program direction, the S/ADM plays a key leadership role with respect to the management of stakeholder relations. And, the incumbent must ensure that program implementation is monitored on a regular basis along with the preparation and submission of both comprehensive annual Monitoring and Assessment reports as well as Management Responses on the El program. Moreover, the incumbent is responsible for the conduct of actuarial reviews of proposed changes to the Employment insurance Program as well as regular assessments of its continuing soundness and ensures the provision of professional geomatics advice to governments in Canada as well as other groups within HRSDC. The other major area of responsibility for the S/ADM involves the provision of ongoing corporate and strategic direction with respect to the program policy, design, analysis, assessment and delivery of a full range of labour market and workplace skills programs including, but not restricted to, Adult Learning, Literacy and Essential Skills, Sector Councils, Trades & Apprenticeships, Active Employment Measures, Foreign Credential Recognition, Temporary Foreign Workers, Opportunities Fund, Labour Market Agreements for Persons with Disabilities, Aboriginal Skills and Employment Partnership Programs in order to enhance the employment opportunities for Youth, Aboriginals, older workers, persons with disabilities and other vulnerable and/or under-employed populations of Canada in the labour market. The incumbent directs the creation and management of frameworks for addressing the Department's and Government's priorities regarding workplace skills development and labour market information partnerships with the provinces and other governments. The S/ADM is accountable for leading the Department's intergovernmental Workplace Skills policy direction, and for stimulating and sustaining collaboration among these partners to increase workplace skills development, utilization and recognition that is responsive to the realities of the changing labour market and the new global economy. This will be achieved through the development of inter-governmental strategies which integrate knowledge and understanding of the national environment as a whole, and of individual environments as they exist in each province/territory, and abroad. The S/ADM also ensures the coherence of federal positions on inter-governmental issues within the Skills and Employment Branch mandate. As the authority on workplace skills policy and on behalf of the Deputy Ministers/Department, the S/ADM leads discussions on federal-provincial issues to examine current policy and program orientation and institutional interfaces to continuously enhance national or specific federal-provincial workplace skills infrastructure. Each of the labour market or workplace skills programs cited above presents its own set of complexities and challenges which must be clearly identified and understood before strategies and approaches to address them can be crafted and implemented. To cite but one example, the area of Aboriginal human capital and skills development presents a number of unique or special challenges.

Human Resources and Social Development Canada respect to creating and sharing the opportunities offered by Canada s economy to Aboriginal people as fundamental ingredients to their social well being, HRSDC must be a major contributor with respect to ensuring that basic needs such as employment are identified and met; ensuring federal funds are directed to the areas of most need and increasingly directing federal effort and activities in a forward-looking fashion to help Canada's First Nations build for the future; and ensuring that program frameworks provide employment experience and developmental opportunities to Aboriginal youth who are seen as essential to the future labour market and economic and social self-reliance and autonomy of Canada's First Nations peoples. A major program policy and design initiative for the S/ADM to direct is the continuing evolution of the Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy by which the department transfers knowledge and capacities to these clients and assists them through the Sectoral Council and other innovative programming in assuming the responsibility to deliver their own human resources development services and activities. The S/ADM must ensure that all these activities support the overarching federal Aboriginal Agenda and its priorities for economic and social development, enhanced employment opportunities, and promoting and enhancing the move to viable forms and models of self-government. The S/ADM must also continue the department's efforts to increasingly engage private sector enterprises in assisting in the economic, employment and social development of Aboriginal communities as often these entities are better suited to help the aboriginal communities in attempting their own entrepreneurial initiatives and can enter into innovative training and employment experience programs. As the senior departmental official with respect to Skills and Employment programs, the incumbent is expected to ensure the provision of authoritative and proactive briefings, advisory and support services to the Ministers, DM and their Offices on all aspects of the Branch s portfolio in order to optimize their advocacy and representational initiatives and activities in Cabinet, Parliament, federal-provincial, federal-partner/stakeholder mechanisms and processes, and in major domestic and international consultative forums, and to enhance their management of sensitive issues involving detailed scrutiny and criticism by local, regional, national and international audiences and publics. The incumbent is expected to provide expert, sound and frequently immediate advice on sensitive issues which directly affect short, medium and long range strategic policy orientations, and to provide recommendations on the management highly visible and politically sensitive issues and/or crisis situations. The S/ADM plays a key role in Labour Market, Skills Development and Employment Insurance program policy decisions taken by the Ministers and the Deputy Ministers and consequently has substantial influence on the directions taken by the federal government in relation to cohesive and efficient El, labour market and skills strategic policies and program orientations. This approach is critical to ensuring HRSDC's optimal, cost-effective Skills, Labour Market and El program service delivery and is key to meeting the workplace and self-sufficiency needs of Canada's human resources. Since implementation of a number of programs which fall under the SEB mandate is carried out by Service Canada offices across the country, the S/ADM must ensure that desired outcomes are clearly articulated and are supported by equally clearly articulated performance measures as well as ensuring the establishment and implementation ciearly of efficient, effective joint governance structures and mechanisms with Service Canada. In addition, as the policy and program authority, the incumbent must ensure the provision of authoritative functional direction, advice and/or guidance to Service Canada operational units.

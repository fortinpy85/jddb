Manager, Skills Development Research EC-O7 staff of 6 - responsible for: managing the development of high-quality evidence-based research and analytical products regarding skills development issues, based on sound analytical framework and methodologies; managing the collaboration with internal and external partners in the development of OECD- led international assessment of skills, such as the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) and the Programme for the International Assessment of Students (PISA), or other skills-related data initiatives. NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments with the greatest impact on the daily lives of citizens. The Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. Lead by five Ministers, six Deputy Ministers (DMs), and twenty-seven ADMs, ESDC programs are grouped as follows: Families, Children and Social Development; Citizen Services encompassing Service Canada and other direct services like passports and employment insurance; Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion; Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, and the Labour Program and Seniors. The Strategic and Service Policy Branch (SSPB) develops and coordinates policy advice and analysis across the Department. The responsibilities of the Branch include the development of economic, social and service policies, and research activities related to ESDC s mandate. It is also the focal point for portfolio-wide strategic planning and priority setting; analysis. guidance and oversight on service-related issues; the Innovation Lab: program evaluation: Cabinet and regulatory affairs: International and intergovernmental relations; and housing. Within SSPB, the Economic Policy Directorate (EPD) provides strategic research, analysis, and economic advice on skills development, labour market, Indigenous, and economic issues with a view to promoting a competitive, growing, and inclusive economy. It assesses Canada s current and future labour market and skills needs to help ensure that ESDC s policies and programs are aligned with these needs and develops innovative responses to emerging challenges. The impact of a global pandemic created unprecedented challenges to labour economists in mapping the way forward in a post-pandemic economy with an efficient labour market. Pre- 2
pandemic mega-trends impacting the labour market and skills development such as population aging and a transition toward a carbon-low economy are still present, while some others (automation, digitalization) have been accelerated by the pandemic. These trends also permanently changed consumer behaviors and forced organizations to revise their b usiness models, which has already started to impact skills sought by these organizations as well as occupation in labour shortages and surplus. In this context, the Director of Labour Market and Skills Research support medium and long - term policy and program development by directing evidence-based economic analyses of mega- trends (national or global) that affect the labour market and skills development in Canada. In particular, the Director leads long-term economic research that examine the implications of demographic changes (e.g., population ageing), technological changes (e.g., Artificial intelligence/automation) and other key economic or societal changes (e.g., transition to a low- carbon economic) for the labour market in terms of pressures and results for Canadians, and for the development of youth and adult skills over the life course. The Director develops a research plan with the vision of positioning the division as a centre of expertise in labour economics within ESDC and across the Government of Canada. The incumbent oversees robust economic research, ensuring the use of proper methodologies and encouraging the use of new methods and sources of information when relevant, to capitalize on all available labour market and skills data, overseeing the preparation and dissemination of research and analytical products. The Director also collaborates with internal and external partners to address key information gaps by leading data development work, such as the Participation of the federal government in OECD-led international skills assessment or other data initiatives. Moreover, and in support of the labour market information function of ESDC, the Director oversees the planning, analytical work and public dissemination of the national assessment of labour market imbalances for near 3OO occupational groups. The Director ensures a broad and efficient diffusion of the division s research and analyses within ESDC portfolio and across federal departments (e.g., PCO, Finance Canada, IRCC, ISED, Statistics Canada, GAC, ECCC, NRCAN, etc.) and other international and domestic research organizations (e.g., OECD, Canadian academics and research centers, etc.). This confirms that the research agenda is well aligned with Government of Canada s priorities and the Department's analyses and research findings complement those from other research organizations in support of sound policies and programs. An essential aspect of the Director's work is looking across all bodies of research to identify interconnections, interdependencies and conflicting findings. The incumbent provides well- informed and integrated advice, briefings and recommendations to the Director General, ADM, DM and Ministers who rely on the acuity, quality and completeness of briefings on potentially sensitive issues that could attract negative media attention. The Director plays a leading role in the governance of the research function within the department, chairing the Portfolio Research and Coordination Committee (PRCC) on Employment and Learning, to create a forum of information exchange, encourage synergies and collaboration, and to avoid duplication of labour market and skills development research within the department. The incumbent establishes and maintains an expert network on research issues and economic methods of common interests with other external research organizations , 3
such as international organizations, think tanks and academics, aligning research efforts, extending dissemination, and validating and improving methods and research techniques. The Director leads by example and ensures the development of plans and strategies to support recruiting and retaining the necessary professional expertise. The incumbent must demonstrate strong operational/organizational skills, sound judgement, and operating environment acumen, and manage allocated resources with probity.

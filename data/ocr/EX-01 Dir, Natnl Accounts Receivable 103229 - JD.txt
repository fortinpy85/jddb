ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada Nature and Scope Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the Department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. It is one of the largest and most complex federal departments. It employs over 24,OOO people and its activities account for almost one out of every three dollars spent by the federal government. The ESDC Portfolio (encompassing the Department, Labour Program and Service Canada) operates within a highly matrixed governance structure and operating model, supporting four Ministers (i.e. Minister of Families, Children and Social Development: Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour; Minister of Public Services, Procurement and Accessibility; and Minister of Seniors). Portfolio organizations operate with five (5) distinct sources of funding the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Employment Insurance Operating Account, the Canada Pension Base Account, the Canada Pension Additional Account, and the Passport Revolving Fund, and deliver a large number of diverse programs to Canadians. Overall Portfolio expenditures are projected to be $I38.3 Billion in FY 2OI9-2O. ESDC has a broad mandate that includes social policies and programs, including Labour, and the delivery of a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives. For example, the Department provides seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education, and assists parents who are taising young children. The Labour Program contributes to social and economic well-being by fostering safe, healthy, fair and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the federal jurisdiction. Service Canada helps citizens access ESDC's programs, as well as other Government of Canada programs and services. Additionally, ESDC now has legislative authority to deliver services on behalf of other organizations and must therefore recover costs for these activities, which adds additional complexity to service delivery operations. ESDC is both a policy and a service organization. As a policy department it plays a significant role in the Government's policy agenda which supports delivery of a number of programs, including over 4O statutory grants and contributions programs. The Policy Branch of ESDC is responsible for the policies of all 4O programs delivered by the Department. These programs include CPP, Employment Insurance, and OAS, as well in excess of 4O Grants and Contributions programs. The Policy Branch has 5 separate sub-branches each with its own area of specialty. These are the Strategy and Service Policy Branch, the Skills and Employment Branch (SEB), the Income Security and Social Development Branch (ISSD), the Labour Program Branch, and the Learning Branch, with total FTEs in excess of 26OO employees. As a service organization", ESDC reaches virtually every Canadian through over 58O of Service Canada's points of service across the country, by phone, in person, or on-line through the canada.ca website. Service Canada, which began operations in late 2OO5 with a mandate to provide Canadians with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits, accounts for the majority of operating results of the Department, employing approximately I7,OOO employees across Canada. Through Service Canada, the Department is responsible for delivering over $I2O Billion in benefits directly to individuals and organizations through such Government of Canada programs and services, such as Employment Insurance, Old Age Security, the Canada Pension Plan, Passport Receiving Agent Services, the Social Insurance Number, and the Canada Student Loans Program. The Department also provides $4.8 Billion in funding to other levels of government, educators and organizations in the voluntary and private sectors. Service Canada is currently undergoing significant change to its operations due to modernization efforts, the greater number of grants and contributions programs, and increased responsibilities in Dir, National Accounts Receivables Page 3 of 7 April I*, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada the realm of service delivery. Significant large scale projects include the closing of 34 Passport Canada Offices across the country and the incorporation of Passport Canada services in the Service Canada sites. Another project involves modernizing Canada s legacy benefit payments system, and recently ESDC has enacted legislation that enables Service Canada to deliver services for partners (OGDs and external organizations) with ensuing cost recovery agreements. This transition and the subsequent increase in complexity necessitates the evaluation and reoptimization of existing service strategies and plans, as well as financial management processes to accommodate this scale up in responsibility, while maintaining a high service standard and prudent financial stewardship. The ICAAD Directorate of the CFO Branch is responsible for ensuring adherence to general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all 4 sets of financial statements, providing departmental accounts payable and receivable operations, grants and contributions financial monitoring, relocation, proactive disclosure and accounting operations services, as well as the development of departmental financial policies and internal control frameworks, and associated processes and procedures. Within this highly complex environment, the Director, National Accounts Receivables, establishes the Directorate as the Centre of Expertise in the Department on national accounts receivable operations, including overpayment reimbursements for the Department's programs including Labour Programs, Employment Insurance, CCP, OAS, Canada Student Loans, Grants and Contributions Programs, salary overpayments and revenue collection for Passport and Temporary Foreign Workers Programs. The Director directs the development and implementation of the framework for accounts receivable operations including all policies, procedures, systems and tools governing the work. The Director is the Department's lead executive in the management and evolution of its accounts receivable system and the generation of timely and accurate statements of account to Canadians. The Director provides senior executive leadership to teams engaged in daily bank reconciliations, and the analysis of CRA system information to identify and rectify anomalies to ensure that payments by Canadians are allocated to the proper overpayment. The Director provides overall leadership to major projects, such as: the merger of the 34 Passport Offices into existing Service Canada sites [which requires the reallocation of significant numbers of personnel, and training of staff to build their capacity in all (existing and merged) services provided by Service Canada; and major transformation and modernization initiatives requiring research into new technology, and the development and prototyping of innovative technologies that can be deployed to improve service and reduce costs, including the use of robotic automation or artificial intelligence to streamline areas of the business which require a great deal of manual effort. The Director provides senior executive oversight to the ongoing evolution of the Department's accounts receivable system. The Director works closely with the I2 Director General program heads to obtain intelligence on the legislative requirements of their programs to ensure the system addresses these needs. Additionally, the Director consults with Legal Services to confirm that systems changes address the various legislative requirements of each program. The Director provides executive leadership to systems development, enhancement and release, as well as to system testing, data transfer, conversion and consolidation, and training of staff to maximize the capabilities of the new system. The Director also leads the development and implementation of strategies and plans to address systems defects. Dir, National Accounts Receivables Page 4 of 7 April I*, 2O2I
ivi Government Gouvernement of Canada du Canada The Director provides leadership to the development and implementation of strategic, business, financial and human resources plans for the Directorate of I26 FTEs located both in Headquarters and across the country. The Director provides expert advice and guidance to the Director General, ICAAD and the CFO on all national accounts receivable issues. There are several challenges for the position. ESDC is a very large department with a considerable amount that distributes large sums of money through a wide variety of essential programs and services. The nature of overpayment recovery for ESDC programs necessitates close coordination with CRA. The evolution of the accounts receivable system and databases is essential to the ongoing success of ESDC collection activity. However, the systems and databases are not currently integrated which hampers collection activity. For example, the legacy systems that store data for CPP and OAS operate on older software that must be modernized to ensure compatibility with the newer system. This interaction between legacy and modern systems necessitates a patchwork of manual workarounds that negatively impact productivity. This environment represents a significant challenge for the position: as the lead on the evolution of accounts receivable systems for ESDC programs, Phoenix overpays, and ESDC G&Cs, the Director must drive change in programs across the Department from a collections perspective which is contrary to their core priority of distribution. Additionally, the Director is challenged to spur innovation and think outside the box in the adoption of leading edge technology (such as Al) to further ease Directorate workload, increase efficiency, and improve collection activities. Service Canada s programs represent the largest outlay of the government for social services, which has contributed to the relative complexity of its financial management operations. Additionally, Service Canada has far-reaching impact across Canada, including other levels of government, indigenous groups, individual Canadians and recipient organizations. As a result of the extensive decentralization of Service Canada s programs, systems must also be tailored for decentralized program delivery. This complex environment poses a significant challenge for the position in ensuring accuracy of collections of overpayments and reporting, and provision of associated advice to senior management. Personnel that specialize in finance are highly sought after in the modern marketplace. As financial tracking and tools become more advanced, specialized, rapidly evolving and capable of tracking many more data points, they are increasingly important to modern organizations. Due to this increase in complexity, more financial expertise and a higher headcount is required by organizations. This represents a challenge for the position as the Director must not only work to recruit and retain employees in an environment of high demand and limited supply, but also develop their skills to accommodate the rapidly evolving nature of the work. Service Canada s foundation programs (El, CPP, OAS, etc.) are highly politically sensitive. These programs involve delivering funds directly to Canadians and as such have the potential to cause a great deal of embarrassment and negative publicity if inaccurate collection of overpayments is done. Furthermore, salary overpayments due to Phoenix are highly sensitive. This highly politicized environment represents a challenge for the position as the pressure to ensure collections activities are conducted in a responsible and timely manner is high. A major challenge is to deliver on transformation initiatives, such as Passport Modernization, while relying on executives over which the position has no line authority, to do their part. The Director acts as a facilitator and catalyst to foster buy-in by other ESDC executives to priorities for Passport Modernization, and leads associated change management.

In recent years, the workplace has become increasingly complex and sensitive. The occupational health and safety area has become increasingly visible as a result of greater concern for accident prevention: joint liability for safety: the short- and long-term health effects of hazardous products, such as chemical products. dust, and asbestos: and the psychological effects of new technologies. At the same time, working conditions and employee relations have taken on new importance as a result of greater awareness of employee rights and obligations and the corresponding responsibility of employers to treat employees equitably. As a result. legislative standards are broader in scope, dealing with subjects such as wrongful dismissal and harassment and subjects involving regular hours of work and salary concepts. The changes have created the need for new techniques to deal 2
th issues wihtere the trend is to rove from enforcement of regulation and control to application that involves persuasion and co-operation to obtain voluntary compliance with legislative requirements. The changes have also contributed to the introduction of non- legislated programs directed at education and co-operation. such as the Client Education Program. The Department of Human Resources and Social Development's Quebec Region is the second largest region, where there are more than 8,OOO labour facilities with many different union organizations, including the major unions, the Conseil des syndicats democratiques (CSD), Conseil des syndicats nationaux (CSN), F d ration des travailleuses et travailleurs du Qu bec (FTQ), and the Centrale des syndicats du Quebec (CSQ). These organizations are unique and completely independent of other union organizations in Canada. mainly as a result of the unique culture in Quebec and the language issue. Co-operation between the department and the various organizations requires a great deal of consultation and dialogue to successfully promote departmental objectives in the region. The Regional Director plans and organizes his/her work, sets priorities, and determines policy to carry out current programs and to develop future work plans. The Regiona! Director has the authority, either by order in council or by being identified in the regulations pursuant to the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act, to make decisions and to authorize and require compliance with the Canada Labour Code and/or associated regulations. The Regional Director can thus determine acceptable occupational health and safety precautions and cases where legal action is required and. where necessary. completely shut down a facility or operation. The Regional Director must be aware at all times of the relationships that exist between the various departmental programs and the dynamics that exist in society in general and among other government stakeholders likely to develop policies that could have an impact on the formulation of departments policy. The Regional Director must have the skills. experience, and resources to carry out specific programs that each have their own characteristics. In co-ordinating various aspects of the programs, the Regional Director must consider external elements, such as provincial industrial policies, economic considerations that are modifying the major features of the Canadian industrial system, public awareness and demands, and so on. These factors strongly influence the analytical and experimental methods used to respond appropriately to repeated, complex. and urgent requests for the department's co-operation. The Regional Director is personally responsible for service delivery and providing the necessary support to enable the department to meet mission-related objectives in the areas of occupational health and safety. labour standards, employment equity, income maintenance for workplace accidents. staff relations. and fire prevention. The Regional Director must provide advice and opinions, in a constantly changing environment, on all aspects of policy and programs under his/her jurisdiction, which must be constantly revised. reinforced, and reassessed to determine their impact on departmental objectives. 3
Che Regional Director must ensure internal management consistent with management recornmended in the region, approve program objectives and operational plans, and translate allocated resources into regional objectives. plans, and budgets. This requires the incumbent to maintain extensive knowledge of government activities. provincial government activities, and priorities proposed by the department, Government, and Cabinet to provide quality services at all times that are sufficiently flexible to allow quick reaction to unexpected events in a setting where resources are limited. The Regional Director is personally accountable for the development of regional policies and procedures, particularly relations with senior representatives of the provincial government, private industry. Crown corporations, union organizations, and other associations to ensure harmonious and consistent program management. Efficient and effective program management largely depends on the incumbent's detailed knowledge not only of the program, but also of problem-solving techniques. The complexity of the programs and problems encountered requires broad knowledge of the subject dealt with and thinking that can incorporate broadly defined areas of activity. In addition to participating actively in the Regional Management Board chaired by the ADM. the Regional Director is required to participate in national working and discussion groups to identify and/or influence departmental policy development while meeting regional needs. He/she also participates on national committees (Directorate Executive Committee) and regional corporate committees. !.e., the regional co-ordinating committee. regional finance committee, regional human resources management committee. regional technology and information management committee, and regional service delivery committee. Main challenges to be met One of the main challenges of the position is to develop policy and strategy concepts and to assess. recommend. and articulate new strategies that operational program and department staff have to implement. In this area. there is an ongoing need to develop new approaches and to balance priorities to meet the needs expressed by clients. Another challenge is to identify acceptable preventive measures in the area of occupational health and safety. the circumstances that warrant legal action and an order to completely close a facility. Such decisions require a balance between the well-being of workers and the social and economic well-being of the community. Other challenges involve translating legislative and policy directives into explicit directions that are easily understood by the officers responsible for the implementation of many programs in the region. It should be added that a large number of national companies have their head offices in the Quebec Region. including Canadian National, Canadian Pacific Ltd., Air Canada. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Bell Quebec, and a number of chartered banks, companies with a strong presence that attempt to influence departmental policy direction and legislative review through the Federally Regulated Employers Transportation and 4
~ommunications Organization (FETCO), whicn has its head office in Montreal. Through | ongoing consultation. they heavily influence the future direction of the Labour Program on a number of occupational health and safety issues of national interest and labour standards for employees throughout Canada. The presence of the head offices in the region means that decisions made by the director may have an impact on decisions made in other regions. Their presence thus requires increased collaboration to ensure homogeneity in decision making, To maintain good relations and to obtain their co-operation in planning future policy directions. the region must also deal with employer groups, such as the Conseil du Patronat du Qu bec and Soci t nationale de l'amiante (SNA). Contacts are also maintained with the Commission de la sant et s curit au travail (CSST), Commission des normes du travail du Qu bec, and major universities established in the province of Quebec. Looking for solutions to occupational health and safety problems involving stevedores in Quebec and Maritime ports must be done in association with the Maritime Employers Association located in Montreal. Freedom of action The Regional Director develops strategies and determines when to consult or obtain approval at a higher level. playing an important role in developing the position of program operations with respect to departmental objectives. The Regional Director has delegated authority for sections 32 and 34 of the Financial Administration Act. Contacts The Regional Director meets with provincial deputy ministers and their senior representatives. heads of Crown corporations, the Public Service and industry, union representatives, and representatives of employer organizations to identify and discuss legislation and regulation and its interpretation. Contacts with a number of the individuals referred to above are also maintained to find solutions to conflicts and to discuss potential closings due to non-compliance. The Regional Director maintains regular contact with the Director General, Assistant Deputy Minister and senior officials at headquarters to submit proposals and new policies. changes in programs, legislation, and regulations and to discuss long-term regional strategic and operational plans.

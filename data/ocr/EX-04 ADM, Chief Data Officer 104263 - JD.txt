NATURE & SCOPE Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including Service Canada and the Labour Program, is one of the largest and most complex federal departments, delivering programs and services that have a positive impact on broad range of clients and on the daily lives of citizens. Lead by four Ministers and six Deputy Ministers (DMs), the Department works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians, supporting initiatives that enable people to participate fully in society and that promote a labour force that is highly skilled, efficient, and inclusive. It does so in part through the delivery of 3I grants and contributions programs involving over $I3O billion to support Canadians of all ages and their needs. The Government of Canada's 3I benefits programs generate vast amounts of data characterized by increasing volume, variety and velocity, and that data can further increase in value when combined with data from other sources. Understanding, processing and analyzing data is complex, but with the use of advanced technologies, it can reveal information that was previously undiscoverable, but is highly valuable in helping the Government improve efficiency, effectiveness and transparency, and ultimately providing better programs and services for all Canadians. To capitalize on this, Government leaders and ESDC Ministers look to the CDO to forge a new path in government, moving data management to data maturity, generating data- driven decisions and making data resources more accessible across Government. The CDO is accountable for envisioning and driving ESDC s data strategy and roadmap to data maturity and ensures the Branch s goals advance the Department's agenda. The CDO understands the strategy and direction of the Department and Government and focuses on ways to leverage data to improve decision making and operations across the policy to service continuum. The CDO leads an approach that drives towards better services and outcomes for all Canadians by providing ESDC with the right enterprise data infrastructure, robust data governance, and levels of data literacy that ensure understanding of data and its potential that enables responsible innovation. 3
Through a consultative and collaborative approach with colleagues in the Department and across government, the CDO evangelizes the power and the positive effects of the mature data strategy and its implementation. When used effectively, innovatively and responsibly, data is an asset with significant potential to increase efficiency, generate insights, drive improvements to programs and services, and build trust across stakeholders and with Canadians. Privacy and security concerns mean that the CDO must work particularly closely with the Chief Information Officer and the Corporate Secretary so that privacy protocols and mechanisms are built directly into data infrastructure and architecture and all ISAs are assessed for compliance. The CDO also collaborates with the ADM of Innovation, Information and Technology on IITB s business applications that access data and process benefit-related transactions to address Canadians needs. The CDO represents the Department and speaks authoritatively for the DM as a member of several ADM-level committees convened by Treasury Board and the Privy Council Office. As the pathfinder and pioneer for the federal government's CDO role, the incumbent demonstrates, socializes and evangelizes the benefits of good data, while building trust across government and among Canadians. The CDO provides expert advice, briefings, and recommendations to the Ministers and DM on issues and opportunities, and emerging risks and priorities related to ESDC 's enterprise data strategy and developments in the data, analytics and digital landscape. This is particularly challenging given the enormous volume of data generated by expanding and evolving benefits programs in a complex and rapidly changing environment characterized by shifting socio- economic conditions and intersectional risks (e.g. economic adjustment after international crises, pandemics); demographic pressures, rapid evolution of technologies and methods in the data and analytics space, and the increased push to modernize and transform programs and services. The CDO must be confident that the most current data and information are used in briefing the DM on sensitive issues and recommending particular courses of action. Data Privacy and security is also a major concern among the many constituents across Canada and the CDO must be in a position to reassure Canadians and their representatives that personal and sensitive data is protected. The CDO is accountable for establishing and maintaining cohesive horizontal data policy frameworks to enable the examination of legislation and data policy through ESDC s and intra/intergovernmental lenses and the development of data policies, standards and directives. Challenges to policy development are created by existing legislative and policy authorities underpinning ESDC s mandate, as well working with the Chief Information Officer to mitigate risks around the security and privacy surrounding the collection and use of personal information. This demands an approach that can work in compliance with the privacy and security legislation, policies and directives, while also highlighting opportunities to strengthen frameworks to both protect the data stewarded by the Department and foster innovation. The CDO faces a significant challenge in establishing a robust and well-accepted data governance structure covering a broad range of stakeholders and users. The ESDC data governance and accountability framework is relied on to ensure data is fit for purpose, secure, private, accurate, available, and used without bias. The CDO directs the development of policies and processes embedded in the governance accountability framework, as well as the use of impact assessments to identify and mitigate risk, to build and foster a culture of data stewardship and collaboration where data is treated as a shared and carefully protected asset. 4
In a context where trust in government has been declining, sound governance is essential to reassuring Canadians that their personal information is being used responsibly, ethically and without bias to drive decisions and the delivery of programs and services that will meet their needs. The CDO is accountable for ESDC s data intelligence plan that includes the foundational data infrastructure, supporting enterprise data architecture and data engineering and enabling robust data governance. The data intelligence strategy consists of a data quality framework, data quality literacy initiatives, and data analytics, analytical platforms and tools like an ecosystem where each element impacts and is impacted by the whole. It provides a foundation for all analysis, modelling, decision-making and reporting across the Department. It also ensures that data policies and standards are correctly and consistently applied. The CDO ensures continuously expanding analytical capabilities to leverage insights from data to support Ministers , DM and other senior officials in their policy and program decision-making responsibilities. The CDO Is accountable for growing ESDC s data culture through data literacy, engagement and awareness initiatives that empower internal stakeholders and users to better understand and use data, weaving data into the operations, mindset, and identity of the Department. The CDO directs the development of messaging to clients and stakeholders that frames the delivery of functions and services under ESDC s Data Strategy in relation to the value of data and analytics in driving innovation, managing risk and improving decision-making. The CDO leads an approach that provides a focus on enabling people and facilitating data-centric behavioural change. The CDO oversees ESDC' s data literacy program to empower employees across the Department to confidently use data and data analytics at key decision points in their work and to communicate with data in meaningful ways. The incumbent capitalizes on opportunities to build and reach the data community through such events as Data Awareness Campaigns, the ESDC Data Community of Practice and other capacity building initiatives and events. The CDO uses the data strategy vision to drive the innovative, ethical, and responsible use of ESDC's data assets to optimize business with innovative approaches that increase the use of data and analytics. The CDO is accountable for driving a shift from siloes to integrated data ecosystems, and enabling observability of the flow of data and the results they generate. Leveraging observability, the CDO ensures that issues are identified and addressed proactively using artificial intelligence models, data visualization, intelligent automation, spatial analysis, and development of prototype uses of these techniques. The CDO is a member of the Departmental Executive Committee, which sets the Department's strategic direction, and of the Departmental Management Committee, which reviews and adjusts program operations. The incumbent proactively provides input to the formulation of departmental policies, priorities, and practices, especially as they all interface with the Department's data strategy and vision.
